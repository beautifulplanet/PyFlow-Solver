"""# Task
Build a CFD solver.

## Define the problem

### Subtask:
Clearly state the physical problem you want to solve, including the governing equations (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations), boundary conditions, and initial conditions.

**Reasoning**:
State the physical problem, governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions for a simple CFD problem.
"""

# 1. Physical Problem:
# We will solve for the steady-state, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a 2D channel with a sudden expansion.
# This is a classic benchmark problem to test CFD solvers.

# 2. Governing Equations:
# We will use the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the continuity equation.

# Continuity Equation:
# del . u = 0
# where u is the velocity vector.

# Momentum Equation (Navier-Stokes):
# rho * (u . del)u = -del(p) + mu * del^2(u) + F
# where rho is the fluid density, p is the pressure, mu is the dynamic viscosity, and F is the body force (assumed to be zero in this case).

# 3. Boundary Conditions:
# - Inlet: Uniform velocity profile (e.g., u = [U_in, 0])
# - Outlet: Zero gauge pressure (p = 0)
# - Walls: No-slip condition (u = [0, 0])

# 4. Initial Conditions:
# For a steady-state problem, the initial conditions can be arbitrary, but a common choice is to set the velocity to zero and the pressure to a constant value throughout the domain.
# u = [0, 0]
# p = 0

"""## Choose a numerical method

### Subtask:
Select an appropriate numerical method to discretize the governing equations in space and time (e.g., Finite Difference, Finite Volume, Finite Element).

**Reasoning**:
Based on the problem characteristics (incompressible, steady-state flow in a channel with expansion) and common practices in CFD, the Finite Volume Method (FVM) is a suitable choice. FVM inherently conserves mass, momentum, and energy, which is crucial for accurate fluid flow simulations. It can also handle complex geometries more easily than Finite Difference Method (FDM) and is computationally less expensive than Finite Element Method (FEM) for this type of problem.
"""

# 1. Research suitable numerical methods:
# - Finite Difference Method (FDM): Discretizes the domain into a grid and approximates derivatives using Taylor series expansions.
# - Finite Volume Method (FVM): Divides the domain into control volumes and applies the conservation laws to each volume.
# - Finite Element Method (FEM): Discretizes the domain into elements and approximates the solution using basis functions.

# 2. Evaluate pros and cons:
# - FDM:
#   - Pros: Relatively easy to implement for simple geometries.
#   - Cons: Difficulty in handling complex geometries, challenges in ensuring conservation.
# - FVM:
#   - Pros: Ensures conservation of physical quantities, can handle complex geometries, widely used for fluid dynamics.
#   - Cons: Can be more complex to implement than FDM for some boundary conditions.
# - FEM:
#   - Pros: Excellent for complex geometries and unstructured grids, strong mathematical foundation.
#   - Cons: Can be computationally expensive for large-scale fluid flow problems, conservation is not inherently guaranteed.

# 3. Choose the most appropriate method:
# For the given problem (incompressible, steady-state flow in a channel with expansion), the Finite Volume Method (FVM) is the most appropriate choice.
# Reasoning:
# - Conservation: FVM inherently conserves mass and momentum within each control volume, which is essential for accurate simulation of fluid flow, especially in regions with strong gradients like the expansion.
# - Geometry: While the channel expansion introduces a change in geometry, FVM can handle such relatively simple geometric changes effectively by using a structured or unstructured grid of control volumes.
# - Suitability for Navier-Stokes: FVM is widely used and well-suited for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
# - Computational Cost: Compared to FEM, FVM is generally less computationally expensive for this type of problem while still providing good accuracy.

"""## Choose a grid type

### Subtask:
Decide on the type of computational grid you will use (e.g., structured, unstructured, Cartesian, curvilinear).

**Reasoning**:
Based on the problem geometry (2D channel with sudden expansion) and the chosen numerical method (Finite Volume Method), I will select an appropriate computational grid type and explain the reasoning.
"""

# 1. Consider the geometry of the problem (a 2D channel with a sudden expansion).
# The geometry is relatively simple, with straight walls and a sudden change in width.

# 2. Evaluate different grid types based on how well they can represent this geometry and how compatible they are with the chosen numerical method (Finite Volume Method).
# - Structured Grid:
#   - Represents the geometry well, especially in the straight sections.
#   - Can be challenging to perfectly align with the sudden expansion without significant grid distortion or complex blocking.
#   - Highly compatible with FVM, leading to efficient matrix solvers.
# - Unstructured Grid:
#   - Can easily conform to the sudden expansion geometry without distortion.
#   - More complex to generate and manage compared to structured grids.
#   - Compatible with FVM, but can lead to less structured matrices, potentially impacting solver efficiency compared to structured grids.
# - Cartesian Grid:
#   - Simple to generate.
#   - Struggles to accurately represent the angled or curved boundaries if present (not the case here, but good to keep in mind).
#   - Can lead to "stair-stepping" approximations of the expansion boundary if not fine enough.
#   - Compatible with FVM.
# - Curvilinear Grid:
#   - Can conform very well to complex geometries.
#   - More complex to generate and implement the discretization on.
#   - Compatible with FVM.

# 3. Select the most suitable grid type, explaining the reasoning behind your choice, considering factors like ease of implementation, accuracy, and computational efficiency for this specific problem.
# For the 2D channel with a sudden expansion, a structured grid is a suitable choice, particularly a multi-block structured grid or a carefully constructed single block grid that handles the expansion.
# Reasoning:
# - Ease of Implementation: Structured grids are generally easier to generate and work with for this type of geometry compared to unstructured or complex curvilinear grids.
# - Compatibility with FVM: Structured grids are highly compatible with FVM, leading to simpler discretization schemes and more efficient linear system solvers.
# - Accuracy: A well-refined structured grid can accurately capture the flow features, including the recirculation zone after the expansion. While an unstructured grid can conform perfectly to the expansion, a structured grid can still represent it adequately, especially with techniques like grid clustering near the expansion.
# - Computational Efficiency: Structured grids often lead to more computationally efficient simulations due to simpler data structures and more optimized solvers.
# A multi-block structured grid could be used to handle the expansion more naturally by having different blocks for the narrow and wide sections of the channel, connected at the expansion interface. However, for simplicity in a basic solver, a single structured grid with careful handling of the expansion boundary is also feasible.

"""## Discretize the equations

### Subtask:
Apply the chosen numerical method to discretize the governing equations on the chosen grid. This will result in a system of algebraic equations.

**Reasoning**:
Describe how the Finite Volume Method (FVM) will be applied to discretize the governing equations on a structured grid, including handling of convective, diffusive, and pressure terms, the velocity-pressure coupling, and outlining the resulting system of algebraic equations.
"""

# 1. Applying FVM to discretize the governing equations on a structured grid:
# The domain is divided into a structured grid of control volumes (cells).
# The governing equations (continuity and momentum) are integrated over each control volume.
# The divergence terms are transformed into surface integrals using the divergence theorem.
# Variables (velocity components u, v, and pressure p) are typically stored at different locations on the grid (staggered grid) or all at the cell centers (collocated grid with special treatment for pressure-velocity coupling). For simplicity in this description, we'll consider a collocated grid, acknowledging that pressure-velocity coupling needs careful handling.

# Continuity Equation (integrated over a control volume P):
# integral(del . u) dV = 0
# Applying divergence theorem:
# integral(u . n) dA = 0
# Sum of mass fluxes across the faces of the control volume is zero.
# For a 2D control volume with faces e, w, n, s:
# (rho * u_e * A_e) - (rho * u_w * A_w) + (rho * v_n * A_n) - (rho * v_s * A_s) = 0
# where u_e, u_w, v_n, v_s are velocities at the cell faces and A are face areas.
# Face velocities are typically interpolated from cell-centered velocities.

# Momentum Equation (for u-velocity, integrated over a control volume P):
# integral(rho * (u . del)u) dV = integral(-del(p)) dV + integral(mu * del^2(u)) dV
# Applying divergence theorem to convective and diffusive terms:
# Convective term: integral(rho * u * u . n) dA
# Diffusive term: integral(mu * grad(u) . n) dA

# 2. Handling of convective and diffusive terms:
# Convective terms:
# Represent the transport of momentum by the fluid flow.
# Various schemes can be used:
# - Central Differencing Scheme (CDS): Simple, second-order accurate, but can be unstable for high Peclet numbers (convection dominated flows) leading to oscillations.
# - Upwind Differencing Scheme (UDS): First-order accurate, stable, but introduces numerical diffusion, smearing sharp gradients.
# - Higher-order schemes (e.g., QUICK, MUSCL): More accurate than UDS and more stable than CDS for high Peclet numbers, but more complex to implement.
# For this problem, a simple solver might start with UDS for stability, or CDS if the flow is not strongly convection-dominated, or a blended scheme. Let's assume UDS for convective terms for stability in this description.
# Example for convective flux across east face: (rho * u_e * A_e) * u_face
# u_face is the velocity value used for convection, typically taken from the upwind cell (UDS).

# Diffusive terms:
# Represent the transport of momentum due to viscosity.
# Typically discretized using Central Differencing Scheme (CDS) for second-order accuracy and stability for diffusive terms.
# Example for diffusive flux across east face: (mu * A_e) * (du/dx)_e
# (du/dx)_e is the gradient of u in the x-direction at the east face, calculated using values from adjacent cell centers.

# 3. Discretizing the pressure gradient term:
# integral(-del(p)) dV = -integral(p * n) dA
# Applying divergence theorem:
# - Sum of pressure forces on the faces of the control volume.
# For a 2D control volume P:
# -(p_e * A_e) + (p_w * A_w) - (p_n * A_n) + (p_s * A_s)
# Face pressures (p_e, p_w, p_n, p_s) are interpolated from cell-centered pressures. For a collocated grid, this interpolation needs care to avoid pressure oscillations (e.g., using Rhie-Chow interpolation).

# 4. Handling the coupling between velocity and pressure:
# The continuity equation does not have a direct pressure term, and pressure is not directly obtained from the momentum equations.
# Velocity and pressure are coupled. An iterative approach is needed.
# Common algorithms include:
# - SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations)
# - SIMPLEC (SIMPLE-Consistent)
# - PISO (Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators)
# These algorithms use a pressure correction method.
# - Solve a 'predictor' momentum equation using a guessed pressure field to get an intermediate velocity field (u*, v*).
# - Solve a pressure correction equation derived from the continuity equation and the relationship between velocity and pressure corrections.
# - Update pressure and velocities using the corrections.
# - Repeat until convergence.
# SIMPLE algorithm is a widely used and robust choice for this type of problem.

# 5. Outline the resulting system of algebraic equations for each control volume:
# For each control volume P, the discretized momentum equations (for u and v) and the continuity equation result in a system of linear algebraic equations.

# For u-momentum (similarly for v-momentum):
# A_P * u_P = Sum(A_nb * u_nb) + S_u
# Where:
# A_P is the coefficient for the central node P, incorporating contributions from convective and diffusive terms.
# A_nb are the coefficients for the neighboring nodes (nb) of P, incorporating contributions from convective and diffusive terms.
# S_u is the source term, which includes the pressure gradient term and any other source terms (like body forces, which are zero here).
# The coefficients A depend on the chosen discretization schemes (UDS, CDS, etc.) and the grid geometry.

# For continuity:
# The discretized continuity equation, when combined with the velocity-pressure coupling algorithm (like SIMPLE), leads to a pressure correction equation of the form:
# B_P * p'_P = Sum(B_nb * p'_nb) + R_c
# Where:
# p' is the pressure correction.
# B coefficients depend on the momentum equation coefficients and grid geometry.
# R_c is the continuity residual (mass imbalance) for the control volume.

# The overall system of equations is non-linear due to the convective terms (velocity appears in the coefficients).
# This system is solved iteratively. In each iteration, the coefficients are updated based on the current velocity field, and the linear systems for momentum and pressure correction are solved.
# The resulting system for the entire domain is a large sparse matrix system that needs to be solved efficiently (e.g., using solvers like Conjugate Gradient or BiCGSTAB).

"""## Solve the system of equations

### Subtask:
Develop or choose a suitable solver for the resulting system of algebraic equations (e.g., iterative solvers like Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, or direct solvers).

**Reasoning**:
Identify the types of linear systems resulting from the discretization and research suitable iterative solvers. Then, choose the solvers for the momentum and pressure correction equations and justify the choices.
"""

# 1. Identify the type of linear system resulting from the discretization.
# The discretization of the momentum equations results in a system of linear equations for each velocity component (u and v) in each iteration of the outer non-linear loop (e.g., SIMPLE).
# The matrix for the momentum equations is generally sparse because each cell's momentum equation only directly involves its neighbors.
# Due to the convective terms (even with UDS), the matrix is typically non-symmetric. The coefficients A_nb and A_P depend on the flow direction.

# The discretization of the pressure correction equation (derived from the continuity equation and velocity-pressure coupling) results in a system of linear equations for the pressure correction p'.
# The matrix for the pressure correction equation is also sparse, connecting neighboring cells.
# This matrix is typically symmetric and positive-definite (or semi-definite, requiring careful handling of the reference pressure) under appropriate conditions and discretization schemes.

# 2. Research suitable iterative solvers for sparse linear systems.
# Iterative solvers are preferred for large sparse systems resulting from CFD problems due to their lower memory requirements and computational cost compared to direct solvers for such systems.
# - For symmetric positive-definite systems (like the pressure correction equation):
#   - Conjugate Gradient (CG): Efficient and widely used for SPD systems.
#   - Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG): CG with a preconditioner to improve convergence.
# - For non-symmetric systems (like the momentum equations):
#   - Bi-conjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGSTAB): A popular choice, generally robust and converges faster than BiCG.
#   - Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES): Another common choice, minimizes the residual at each step, can be very effective but memory requirement increases with iteration count unless restarted.
#   - Other methods include BiCG, TFQMR, etc.

# 3. Choose appropriate solvers for the momentum equations and the pressure correction equation.
# Based on the system characteristics and common practices in CFD:
# - For the Momentum Equations (non-symmetric sparse matrix):
#   - Choose BiCGSTAB or GMRES. BiCGSTAB is often a good default choice due to its balance of robustness and memory usage compared to GMRES without restart. Let's choose BiCGSTAB.
# - For the Pressure Correction Equation (symmetric sparse matrix):
#   - Choose Conjugate Gradient (CG) or Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG). PCG with a suitable preconditioner (e.g., Incomplete Cholesky or Algebraic Multigrid) is generally much faster than CG for large problems. Let's choose PCG.

# 4. Briefly justify the choice of solvers.
# - BiCGSTAB for Momentum: Chosen because the momentum equations result in a non-symmetric linear system in each iteration of the outer loop. BiCGSTAB is a well-established and generally efficient iterative solver for such systems in CFD applications.
# - PCG for Pressure Correction: Chosen because the pressure correction equation results in a symmetric (often SPD) linear system. Conjugate Gradient is the standard method for SPD systems, and preconditioning (PCG) is crucial for achieving practical convergence rates in large CFD simulations.

# Sp_cell = mass_in - mass_out # Calculated from face fluxes of u_star and v_star
# Calculate the coefficients (Bp, B_nb) for the pressure correction equation.
# These coefficients are related to the momentum equation coefficients (A_P, A_nb) and grid geometry.

# 8. Assemble sparse linear system for Ap * p' = Sp
# Create a sparse matrix Ap and a source vector Sp (continuity residuals).
# The size of the matrix will be (Nx-1)*(Ny_out-1) by (Nx-1)*(Ny_out-1).

# 9. Solve Ap * p' = Sp using PCG (cg with preconditioner)
# Use scipy.sparse.linalg.cg to solve the system for the pressure correction p'.
# A preconditioner is highly recommended for performance.
# Example: Use an Incomplete Cholesky preconditioner if Ap is symmetric positive-definite.
# from scipy.sparse.linalg import spilu, LinearOperator
# M_ilu = spilu(Ap) # Incomplete LU factorization (for non-symmetric, but can approximate)

# p_prime_flat, info_p = cg(Ap, Sp.flatten(), tol=1e-9, M=M) # Example call with preconditioner
# Reshape p_prime_flat back to the grid shape.

# Update pressure and velocity fields:
# p_new = p_old + relaxation_factor_p * p_prime
# u_new = u_star + f(p_prime, Ap_coeffs) # Update u_star using pressure correction gradient
# v_new = v_star + f(p_prime, Ap_coeffs) # Update v_star using pressure correction gradient
# Apply relaxation factors for stability.

# 10. Implement boundary conditions
# Boundary conditions are typically incorporated into the coefficient calculation and source terms
# during matrix assembly.
# - Inlet: Fix u, v values. Modify equations for cells near inlet.
# - Outlet: Fix pressure (p=0 gauge). Modify equations for cells near outlet.
# - Walls: Fix u=0, v=0. Modify equations for cells near walls.

# 11. Check for convergence
# Calculate residuals for momentum and continuity equations.
# Residuals are typically the L2 norm of the difference between the left and right sides of the discretized equations, or the sum of mass imbalances for continuity.
# momentum_residual = ...

### Subtask:
Verify and validate the implemented solver by comparing its results to known analytical solutions or benchmark cases for simple flow problems.

**Reasoning**:
Choose a simple benchmark problem with an analytical solution and adapt the current solver framework (or outline how it would be adapted) for this problem. Fully developed laminar flow in a straight channel is a good choice.
"""

# 1. Choose a simple benchmark problem:
# Fully developed laminar flow between two infinite parallel plates (Poiseuille flow).
# This problem has a well-known analytical solution for the velocity profile and pressure drop.
# Assumptions:
# - Steady-state
# - Incompressible Newtonian fluid
# - Laminar flow
# - 2D
# - Infinite plates (reduces to 1D flow in the direction perpendicular to the plates)
# - No body forces

# Analytical Solution:
# Velocity profile: u(y) = - (1 / (2 * mu)) * (dp/dx) * (H/2)^2 * (1 - (y / (H/2))^2)
# Where:
# u is the velocity in the x-direction
# y is the coordinate perpendicular to the plates (with y=0 at the center)
# mu is the dynamic viscosity
# dp/dx is the constant pressure gradient in the x-direction
# H is the distance between the plates
# The maximum velocity occurs at the center (y=0): u_max = - (1 / (2 * mu)) * (dp/dx) * (H/2)^2
# The average velocity is 2/3 of the maximum velocity.

# 2. Adapt the solver code framework for this benchmark problem:
# The current solver framework is for a 2D channel expansion, which is more complex.
# For fully developed Poiseuille flow, the problem is essentially 1D in the y-direction
# (assuming flow is in the x-direction and fully developed means no change in x).

# Simplified domain for simulation:
# A 2D rectangular domain representing a section of the channel.
# Length L in the x-direction, height H in the y-direction.
# Inlet boundary: Fully developed velocity profile (the analytical solution)
# Outlet boundary: Zero gauge pressure
# Top and bottom walls: No-slip (u=0, v=0)
# Periodic boundary conditions in the x-direction could also be used to simulate fully developed flow without specifying an inlet profile, but using the analytical inlet profile is a direct way to verify the solver's ability to maintain that profile.

# Adapt the grid:
# A simple 2D structured grid of size Nx * Ny.
# Lx = some length (e.g., 1.0)
# Ly = H (the distance between plates, e.g., 1.0)
# Nx = some number of points (e.g., 10)
# Ny = some number of points (e.g., 21) - important to have enough points in the y-direction to capture the profile.

# Adapt the boundary conditions:
# - Inlet (x=0): u = analytical u(y), v = 0
# - Outlet (x=Lx): p = 0 (gauge pressure)
# - Top wall (y=H): u = 0, v = 0
# - Bottom wall (y=0): u = 0, v = 0

# Adapt the equations and solver:
# - The 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are still the governing equations.
# - The FVM discretization and SIMPLE algorithm structure remain the same.
# - The main adaptation is in setting up the boundary conditions and potentially simplifying
#   the coefficient calculations if exploiting the 1D nature of the fully developed flow
#   (though solving the full 2D equations is a better test of the 2D solver).

# For verification, we will simulate the 2D domain with the analytical inlet profile
# and check if the velocity profile remains the same downstream and if the pressure
# drops linearly along the channel with the correct gradient.

# Step 1: Improve Grid Resolution and Implement Non-uniform Grid

# For the main channel expansion problem:
# Increase the number of grid points

Ny_in = 41 # Increased Ny for inlet section
Ny_out = 81 # Increased Ny for outlet section

# Define domain dimensions (already defined in previous cells, but repeated for clarity)

Ly_in = 1.0
Ly_out = 2.0
Lx_expansion = 1.0 # Assuming expansion at x = 1.0

# Implement non-uniform grid in the y-direction, finer near walls and expansion
# This requires more sophisticated grid generation than simple linspace.
# For simplicity and demonstration, let's implement a stretched grid in y for the full Ly_out height.
# A common stretching function is based on a hyperbolic tangent.

def tanh_stretch(n_points, domain_length, stretching_factor):

    return stretched_xi * 0.5 * domain_length

# Stretching factor: higher value means more stretching (points clustered near ends)
stretching_factor_y = 3.0 # Example value, needs tuning

# Generate non-uniform y-coordinates for the full height Ly_out
y_nodes_full = tanh_stretch(Ny_out, Ly_out, stretching_factor_y)

# Generate uniform x-coordinates for the full length Lx for now
x_nodes = np.linspace(0, Lx, Nx)

# For the main channel expansion problem, the grid needs to handle the transition from Ny_in to Ny_out.
# A simple way is to have a uniform grid in y up to Ly_in in the first section [0, Lx_expansion],
# and the stretched grid in y for the full Ly_out height in the second section [Lx_expansion, Lx].
# This creates a discontinuous grid at the expansion, which is not ideal but simpler than
# a smoothly transitioning structured grid or an unstructured grid.
# A better approach for a structured grid is multi-block or using a grid generator that handles expansion.
# For the purpose of refining the *implemented* solver, let's stick to a single grid but acknowledge the ideal approach.

# dy_in = Ly_in / (Ny_in - 1) # Recalculate with new Ny_in

# A pragmatic approach for this exercise: Use a single grid covering [0, Lx] x [0, Ly_out]
# with Nx and Ny_out points, but handle the boundary conditions at the Ly_in level for x < Lx_expansion.

"""**Reasoning**:
The placeholder solver converged immediately with zero residuals, which is incorrect and expected due to the simplified placeholder logic. The next steps are to start implementing the actual discretization schemes (steps 2 & 3), boundary conditions (step 4), and the core SIMPLE algorithm steps (step 5), including the correct velocity updates using pressure correction. I will focus on implementing a basic Upwind Differencing Scheme (UDS) for convection and Central Differencing Scheme (CDS) for diffusion within the `assemble_momentum_matrix` and `assemble_pressure_correction_matrix` functions, and implement a more realistic `calculate_continuity_residual`. I will also refine the boundary condition application within these functions and implement the correct velocity update step.

Implement the necessary boundary conditions for the channel expansion problem within the solver.

I need to create a test script for the solver using a benchmark problem. This involves creating a new file, setting up the benchmark problem parameters and grid, calling the solver (or an adapted version), extracting results, comparing them to the analytical solution, and using `pytest.approx` for assertions. Since the current solver implementation might not converge for the complex channel expansion problem, I will adapt the solver setup within the test script to specifically solve the simpler fully developed channel flow benchmark, which has a known analytical solution. I will create the `tests/test_solver.py` file and include the necessary code for the benchmark test.

"""**Reasoning**:
The error persists because the string replacement in the previous steps only modified the `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction_vectorized` function and its call within the `solve` function. However, the error occurs *inside* the `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction_vectorized` function itself, where `U_in` is used but not defined within that function's scope. I need to modify the `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction_vectorized` function definition to accept `U_in` as an argument, and the `solve` function already passes it. I will also need to modify the `calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized` function as it also uses `U_in` without it being in its arguments. I will read the solver code again, add `U_in` to the arguments of both functions, and then re-run the relevant part of the notebook cell.

"""## Analyze and visualize results

### Subtask:
Analyze the computed flow field and visualize the results from the channel expansion problem and validation benchmarks to gain insights into the fluid behavior and assess accuracy.

**Reasoning**:
The previous steps have set up the modular structure, implemented (conceptually and with placeholders) the core solver logic including some boundary conditions, and added verification and validation tests and configuration file handling. The current subtask is to analyze and visualize the computed flow field and assess the results. This involves ensuring the `run_solver.py` script has been executed to generate the data file, executing the `visualize_results.py` script to load and plot the data, and then interpreting the resulting plots. Since the full solver did not converge in the previous steps (as indicated by the output logs), the visualization step will likely show non-converged or unphysical results for the main channel expansion problem. The analysis step will focus on describing what is seen in the plots and relating it back to the solver's current state (placeholder or non-converged). I will then finish the task, acknowledging the limitations.

"""**Reasoning**:
The `run_solver.py` script still failed with a `NameError: name 'U_in' is not defined` in the `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction` function. This confirms the issue identified in previous steps where `U_in` was used in helper functions within `solver.py` but not passed as an argument. I need to modify the `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction_vectorized` function signature and its call within the `solve` function in `pyflow/solver.py` to pass `U_in`. After fixing this, I will re-attempt to run `run_solver.py` and then `visualize_results.py`.

"""**Reasoning**:
The repeated "Could not find signature/call" messages and the persistent `NameError` indicate that the automated string replacement is failing to correctly identify and modify the function names or lines in `solver.py`. The function names might be slightly different than expected, or the string matching is too strict. I need to perform a final attempt to fix the `solver.py` by loading its content, manually searching for the function definitions and calls for both `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction_vectorized` and `calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized` based on their surrounding code structure, and then manually inserting the `U_in` argument into their signatures and calls. I will use the provided `U_in` value from the previous context. After this final manual fix attempt, I will re-run `run_solver.py` and `visualize_results.py`. If this fails, the complexity of manually fixing the code in this iterative format will prevent further progress on this subtask.

"""**Reasoning**:
The `NameError` for `U_in` in `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction` persists. This strongly suggests that the manual string replacement attempts are failing to correctly modify the function's signature in `pyflow/solver.py`. I need to ensure the signature of `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction_vectorized` includes `U_in`. Since automated replacement is proving unreliable, I will attempt a targeted line modification based on the traceback line number (line 358 in the latest error, which is *inside* the function, implying the signature or call *to this function* from `solve` is the issue). The error is in `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction`, not `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction_vectorized`, indicating the wrong function is being called or modified. I need to correct the function name being targeted for the fix. The traceback points to `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction`. I will fix the signature and call for *that* function and the `calculate_continuity_residual_actual` function, as the error also shows the call from `solve` is to `update_velocity_from_pressure_correction`, not the vectorized version. It seems the solver code still contains the original, non-vectorized function names in the `solve` loop calls.
