# Failures: All Attempts

## VS Studio
- Numerical instability at high Reynolds numbers (see benchmark_failure_report.txt)
- Non-finite values in computed results
- Solver divergence and pressure-velocity coupling errors

## Colab
- RAM limitations, incomplete runs, and failed solver tests
- Incomplete or untested prototype implementations

## Text Frameworks (Dosidon, SSQF, CPSAIL)
- Theoretical breakdowns, unproven axioms, and unresolved singularities
- Documentation of failed or abandoned approaches

## Lessons Learned
- See each section for detailed analysis and recommendations.
