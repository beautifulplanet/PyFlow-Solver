# VS Studio Attempts: Postmortem

## Successful Implementations
- Detailed review of all working code, solver logic, and results from VS Studio projects.
- Includes: CFD_Engine, pyflow_solver, validation scripts, and benchmark results.
- See extracted code and documentation for each solver and test.

## Failures
- Documented errors, failed benchmarks, and instability reports (e.g., benchmark_failure_report.txt, last_benchmark_output.txt).
- Analysis of causes (e.g., numerical instability, non-finite values, pressure-velocity coupling issues).
- Lessons learned and recommendations for future attempts.
