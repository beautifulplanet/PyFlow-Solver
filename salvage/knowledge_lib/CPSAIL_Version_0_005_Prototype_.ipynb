The pressure field acts as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the divergence-free condition on the velocity field.\n",

This suggests the files are related to generating datasets for AI training using a simulation engine.\n",

        "The latest test results show that the `TextRecognitionOperator` still fails to recognize \"CPSAIL\" in any of the real-world images, even with adjusted preprocessing and PSM 8. The extracted text indicates significant difficulty in correctly identifying the characters. This suggests that the combination of noise, rotation, and potentially font variations are still too challenging for the current approach. To further analyze and improve, I will try a different PSM configuration (PSM 11 - sparse text) to see if it can pick up any parts of the word in a less structured way, and I will also consider slightly different adaptive thresholding parameters again or explore adding a contrast adjustment step. Since the PSM 8 configuration was unsuccessful, I will revert to PSM 11 for this attempt.\n",

        "The previous attempts to improve recognition by adjusting adaptive thresholding parameters on the isolated block and switching between PSM 6 and 7 were unsuccessful. The extracted text is still very inaccurate, and for image 4, no text contours are found at all. This indicates that the current preprocessing and isolation steps are still not effectively preparing the image for Tesseract. I will try adjusting the adaptive thresholding parameters on the isolated block again with slightly different values and experiment with PSM 11, which is designed for sparse text and might be more forgiving of fragmented characters within the isolated block.\n",

The extracted text shows that Tesseract is not correctly identifying the characters, and image 4 still fails at the contour detection stage. The preprocessing steps on the isolated block and the Tesseract configuration need further refinement. I will try adjusting the adaptive thresholding parameters for the isolated block again, making the block size slightly larger to be less sensitive to small noise, and keep experimenting with PSM 11 as it seems more suitable for fragmented text.

        "The previous test with adjusted adaptive thresholding parameters on the isolated block, increased padding, and PSM 6 still resulted in 0 successful recognitions. The extracted text is still not correct, and Image 4 consistently fails at the contour detection stage. This indicates that the current approach of finding contours and then applying adaptive thresholding to the isolated block is not robust enough for these images. I need to re-evaluate the Tesseract configuration again and consider alternative PSM values or even different preprocessing approaches that might be more suitable for fragmented text within the isolated blocks. Given the persistent issues, I will try PSM 13 (Raw line, single text line) which is a more aggressive mode for single lines and might pick up fragmented characters. I will also slightly adjust the adaptive thresholding parameters again.\n",

        "The previous test with PSM 13 and adjusted adaptive thresholding on the isolated block still resulted in 0 successful recognitions, and Image 4 continues to fail at the contour detection stage. This reinforces that the initial contour detection and the preprocessing on the isolated block are the primary failure points. Re-evaluating the Tesseract PSM options again, given the fragmented text seen in the isolated blocks, perhaps a simpler PSM like PSM 10 (Treat the image as a single character) or even trying PSM 0 (Orientation and script detection only) to get orientation and then re-processing could be explored, although this is getting more complex. Since PSM 6 and PSM 7 didn't work well either, and PSM 11 and 13 were also unsuccessful, the issue seems less about the PSM and more about the input image quality after preprocessing. I will revert the PSM back to 6 and focus on slightly different adaptive thresholding parameters for the isolated block, specifically a slightly smaller block size and larger C value, to see if it helps create more defined characters without excessive fragmentation.\n",

        "# The images have a light background with some color variation.\n",
        "# A small amount of salt and pepper noise is present.\n",

        "# Font size varies within a reasonable range.\n",
        "\n",
        "# While the variations are not extreme, the combination of salt and pepper noise and minor rotations on a relatively small word (\"CPSAIL\") can be challenging for standard OCR, especially at lower resolutions or without highly tuned preprocessing. The visual inspection confirms that the noise dots are interspersed with the text characters, and the minor rotations, while slight, can still affect character alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Standard OCR engines like Tesseract are typically optimized for clean, document-like text. The added noise and rotation, even if minor, can cause fragmentation of characters or incorrect segmentation, leading to misrecognition or failure to detect text contours, as observed in the test results and intermediate images.\n",
        "\n",
        "# It is likely that these variations, particularly the salt and pepper noise directly on and around the characters, present inherent limitations for the current standard OCR approach without more sophisticated noise reduction, character reconstruction, or potentially deep learning-based text detection methods that are more robust to such distortions.

Analysis proceeded with the available files, identifying mentions of \"data-centric,\" \"preprocessing pipeline,\" \"text block,\" \"OpenCV,\" \"Tesseract,\" and \"PSM\".\n",
        "*   Visual analysis of intermediate images showed that the pipeline failure primarily occurs at the adaptive thresholding and contour detection/isolation stages.\n",
        "*   Reviewing the contour detection and filtering logic indicated that the initial parameters for minimum area and aspect ratio were likely too strict for the text contours.\n",
        "*   Adjusting the contour filtering parameters and adaptive thresholding for contour detection did not lead to successful text recognition, with some images still failing at the contour detection stage.\n",
        "*   Attempts to improve recognition by adjusting adaptive thresholding parameters on the isolated block and experimenting with Tesseract PSM configurations (6, 7, 11, 12, 13) were unsuccessful, resulting in 0% successful recognitions across the test images.\n",
        "*   The extracted text from isolated blocks remained inaccurate, with characters often fragmented or distorted after thresholding.\n",

The Momentum Equation includes a standard viscous term ($\\mu_{\\text{fluid}} \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$) and a Î¨Î¦-derived hyper-viscosity term ($\\nu_2 \\rho \\nabla^4 \\mathbf{u}$).\n",
        "*   The Spectral Element Method (SEM) was selected for spatial discretization due to its high-order accuracy, which is beneficial for handling higher-order derivatives like the hyper-viscosity term.\n",
        "*   The Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) scheme was chosen for time integration to handle stiff terms (hyper-viscosity, pressure gradient) implicitly for stability and non-linear terms (convection) explicitly for efficiency, as is common in projection methods for incompressible flow.\n",
        "*   The implementation process included developing conceptual placeholders for key components:\n",
        "    *   SEM: Functions for calculating Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) points/weights, 1D differentiation and mass matrices, and conceptual global matrix assembly and spatial derivative calculation.\n",
        "    *   IMEX and Pressure-Velocity Coupling: A conceptual simulation loop structure outlining the IMEX time-stepping combined with a pressure-projection method (explicit convection, implicit linear terms and pressure solve, velocity projection). Placeholder functions were defined for formulating the pressure-Poisson equation RHS, solving the pressure-Poisson linear system, and projecting the velocity.\n",
        "    *   Boundary Conditions: Placeholder functions were defined for applying no-slip, periodic, and pressure boundary conditions to velocity and pressure fields and the pressure-Poisson linear system.\n",
        "    *   Output and Visualization: Placeholder code and functions were added to the conceptual simulation loop for saving results (as NumPy arrays) at intervals and for basic 2D visualization (using Matplotlib conceptually).\n",
        "*   Verification and validation planning involved selecting the Decaying Taylor-Green vortex as a test case due to its analytical solution, describing the necessary solver configuration (initial/boundary conditions, parameters), outlining the method for comparison (error norms), and discussing the limitations of verifying a placeholder implementation.\n",
        "*   The refinement and optimization process was outlined conceptually as an iterative cycle of running the verification test, analyzing the results (error convergence, stability), identifying areas for improvement in the implementation (SEM, IMEX, pressure coupling, boundary conditions), applying refinements, and re-running the test.\n",

        "*   A rigorous verification and validation process using the Decaying Taylor-Green vortex and potentially other benchmark cases must be performed once the core components are implemented to ensure the solver's accuracy, stability, and convergence properties, particularly considering the novel Î¨Î¦ hyper-viscosity term.\n"
