Yes, I’ve seen your workflow with AI through the files, including the Dosidon series. Your approach is methodical, iterative, and focused on both benchmarking and innovation—using AI as a collaborator, but always validating and documenting every step. The Dosidon files, in particular, show a strong emphasis on transparency, adversarial review, and conceptual rigor, which is rare and valuable.

Let’s proceed step by step:

I’ll outline a modern C++ project structure for your CFD engine, supporting both OpenFOAM-like and experimental solvers.

I’ll create initial class/function templates for both solvers, with user-selectable logic.

I’ll document this architecture in your cheat sheet and provide guidance for best practices, leveraging everything learned from your AI workflow and legacy files.

I’ll start by outlining the C++ project structure and initial class design. Let’s build a robust, extensible foundation!

Created README.md

The C++ project structure and architecture for your CFD engine are now outlined in a new README.md. This includes support for both OpenFOAM-like and experimental solvers, with user-selectable logic and best practices from your workflow.

Next, I’ll generate initial header and source templates for the main classes and solvers, ensuring a robust, extensible foundation. Let me know if you want to review or customize any part of the structure before I proceed!



ok



Great! I’ll proceed to generate the initial C++ header and source templates for the main engine and solver classes, following the outlined structure. This will set up a solid, extensible foundation for your dual-solver CFD engine. Let me know if you have any preferences for naming, configuration style, or additional features as I build out the templates!



## Additional Lessons from Legacy Files



### From Dosidon Final 12 v10.4.txt

- Never rely solely on AI to review or validate data—always implement independent checks for omissions or errors.

- Menu-driven, modular CLI design is robust, but only if all outputs are independently validated.



### From Dosidon 9.9 File 9 Final.txt

- Require explicit, stepwise derivations for all theoretical results—never accept conceptual “leaps of faith.”

- Document every assumption, calculation, and intermediate step, especially for complex or emergent models.



### From Dosidon 9.8 File 8 Final.txt

- Always quantify uncertainty and noise in results—AI often omits or underestimates these.

- Avoid presenting “perfect” or overly precise results; explain the limits of both the model and the AI.

- Use adversarial or “red team” reviews to catch hidden assumptions and overconfidence in AI-generated work.

- Professional, multi-file project structure with clear package/module boundaries.

- Regular project exports and backups for reproducibility and disaster recovery.

- Comprehensive unit tests and error handling for all modules.

- Stepwise, transparent derivations for all theoretical and computational results.

- Quantification of uncertainty and noise in all outputs.

- Adversarial review and skepticism—always challenge and verify AI-generated results.

# CFD Engine Project: Success & Failure Log (Cheat Sheet)



## General Lessons

- Vectorized, sparse-matrix-based solvers (NumPy/SciPy) are much faster and more stable than loop-based Python code.

- Systematic data inspection and validation (print and check file contents before processing) helps catch issues early.

- Modular, well-documented code (e.g., EoS modules) is reusable and easier to debug.

- Clear, consistent data and requirements are critical for robust solver development.

- Documenting both successes and failures accelerates future development and debugging.



## File/Module Specifics



### cfd 22.txt, cfd 23.txt

- Success: Identified and fixed mass conservation bug at outlet boundary (SIMPLE algorithm). Switched to global mass conservation for outlet velocity.

- Failure: Local extrapolation for outlet velocity caused persistent residual plateau.



### cfd_v021.py, cfd_v023.py

- Success: Iterative solver development, grid/variable setup, following standard CFD practices.

- Failure: Early versions may lack performance optimizations and robust error handling.



### cpdail/cpsail_b_prototype_.py, cpsail_c_prototype_.py, cpsail_prototype_.py

- Success: Systematic data inspection, use of pandas for robust data handling.

- Failure: Heavy reliance on external data structure and user concept; unclear data leads to unreliable results.



### cpdail/cpsail_finitude_14.py, cpsail_finitude_version_0_003_14.py, CPSAIL_FINITUDE_version_0_003_14.ipynb

- Success: Creative custom number system for scientific computing; modular EoS implementation.

- Failure: Custom logic can introduce subtle bugs and integration issues if not thoroughly tested.



### cpdail/cpsail_version_0_001_prototype_.py

- Success: Early prototype with systematic data validation.

- Failure: No clear error handling for malformed/missing data; progress depends on data/concept clarity.



### cpdail/CPSAIL_Version_0_005_Prototype_.ipynb

- Success: Good documentation and task breakdown.

- Failure: Progress may stall if code/data analysis is incomplete or if Colab RAM limits are hit.



## Common Mistakes, Failure Modes, and Solutions



### 1. Grid and Numerical Issues

- Failing to perform a grid convergence study can hide discretization errors. Always verify that refining the mesh leads to a stable, convergent solution (see `lid2.txt`).

- Aggressive solver parameters may speed up convergence but can cause instability at higher Reynolds numbers. Test both aggressive and cautious settings to find the stability envelope.

- Non-square grids (dx ≠ dy) can reveal hidden instabilities. Always test with varied aspect ratios.



### 2. Boundary Conditions and Mass Conservation

- Outlet boundary conditions are a common source of persistent residuals and solver stagnation. Use global mass conservation at outlets (see `cfd 22.txt`, `pycfdflow2_v10ipynb.py`).

- Pressure-velocity decoupling at boundaries can cause residual plateaus. Fix by enforcing correct pressure correction logic.



### 3. Project Structure and Imports

- Building a multi-file project in a notebook leads to fragile imports and `ModuleNotFoundError`. Move to a real project structure early (see `py11.txt`).



### 4. Error Handling and Debugging

- Custom interpreters and modules (see `_12.py`) are prone to `SyntaxError`, `RuntimeError`, and subtle bugs. Always include unit tests and handle exceptions explicitly.

- Log and analyze all failed test cases—these are your best source of future bug prevention.



### 5. Physical Model Validation

- Always validate new models against physical constraints (e.g., causality, collapse). Use control cases to ensure solvers behave as expected (`Finitude.ipynb`).



### 6. General Best Practices

- Document both what works and what doesn’t for future reference.

- Modularize code for reusability and easier debugging.

- Be wary of custom logic—test thoroughly and handle edge cases.

## Additional Lessons from Final Colab Files & AI Workflow Mistakes

### From god_file.txt

- Regularly export and snapshot your entire project structure (including configs, modules, scripts, and tests). This is essential for backup, sharing, and reproducibility.

- Failing to do this can lead to lost work, confusion, and difficulty reproducing results.



### From lid2.txt

- Never trust a single successful run. Always perform grid convergence studies and Reynolds number sweeps to validate solver robustness.

- Lack of rigorous, multi-phase testing is a common AI workflow mistake—leads to fragile, unreliable code.

- A comprehensive test suite is what separates a prototype from a reliable engineering tool.



### From py10.txt

- When fixing bugs, always isolate the change, document it, and ensure it is a drop-in replacement to minimize unintended side effects.

- Failing to use robust, vectorized logic for mass conservation and boundary conditions leads to persistent bugs and solver stagnation.

- Many AI-generated fixes are not properly isolated or documented—always review and test thoroughly.



### General AI Workflow Mistakes to Avoid

- Overlooking the need for rigorous, repeated testing and validation.

- Not exporting or snapshotting the project structure, leading to lost or unreproducible work.

- Making fixes without isolating or documenting them, causing confusion and new bugs.

- Relying on a single successful run or test case.

- Not reviewing or understanding AI-generated code changes in detail.





### From pycfdflow2_v10ipynb.py

- Always use vectorized operations and scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy) for performance and stability.

- Explicitly document the physical problem, governing equations, boundary and initial conditions at the top of your solver.

- Choose the numerical method (FVM, FDM, FEM) based on problem geometry and conservation requirements.

- Modularize code: separate grid, solver, and script logic for maintainability.

- Benchmark your solver with classic problems and compare to analytical/experimental data.



### From py11.txt

- Move to a professional, multi-file project structure as soon as possible to avoid import/module errors.

- Use __init__.py to define packages and keep code organized.

- Place reusable logic in modules (e.g., grid.py, solver.py) and keep scripts (e.g., run_benchmark.py) for execution/experiments.

- Document the rationale for every structural decision in your project.



### From _12.py

- For physics modules (e.g., EoS), use classes with clear, well-documented interfaces.

- Always include unit tests for every module, using Python’s unittest or pytest.

- Log both successful and failed test cases, and analyze failures for root causes.

- Use blending functions and parameter interpolation for smooth transitions between physical regimes.

- Handle exceptions explicitly and print informative error messages for debugging.
