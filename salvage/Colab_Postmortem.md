# Colab Attempts: Postmortem

## Successful Implementations
- Review of all Colab-based solver prototypes and notebooks (CPSAIL, Dosidon, etc.).
- Details on working code, solver logic, and test results.
- Notebooks: CPSAIL_Version_0_003_Prototype_, PyCFDflow2, and related files.

## Failures
- Documented errors, failed runs, and resource limitations (e.g., RAM issues, incomplete runs).
- Analysis of causes and lessons learned.
