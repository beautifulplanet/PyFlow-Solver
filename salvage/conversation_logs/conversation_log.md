## 01. Workspace Ingestion & Forensic Scan ([FORENSICS])
Initial request: perform a comprehensive post‑mortem / audit of a sprawling CFD-related workspace with many legacy & experimental files.
Actions:
- Implemented recursive scanner (`workspace_full_scan.py`) enumerating files, code vs text classification, notebook detection (nbformat guarded), keyword counts.
- Generated full inventory JSON and early metrics (lines, extensions, code/text ratio).
Outcome: Baseline visibility across heterogeneous artifacts (scripts, notebooks, txt design notes).

## 02. Deep Analytics Layer ([ANALYTICS])
Intent: move beyond listing to semantic structuring.
Actions:
- Built evolution chains, dependency centrality hints, function name catalogs.
- Produced semantic / TF‑IDF embeddings index for future duplicate & topic queries.
Outcome: Knowledge base enabling targeted refactors and future de‑duplication.

## 03. Multi‑Stage Workflow Planning ([GOV])
User asked for iterative workflow plans (initial, +20 refinements, +100 micro‑refinements).
Actions: Delivered layered strategy: discovery → stabilization → physics hardening → validation → performance → packaging → governance gates.
Outcome: Shared roadmap; aligned expectations for moving toward “commercial‑grade” solver.

## 04. Educational Assets / Textbook Scaffold ([EDU])
Actions: Produced textbook outline & chapter skeletons (governing equations, discretization, linear solvers, turbulence placeholders, verification & validation methods, performance engineering, governance & reproducibility).
Outcome: Structured pedagogical track running parallel to engineering implementation.

## 05. Experimental Playground Scripts ([PLAY])
Actions: Added prototype scripts to test manufactured solutions, adaptive dt concepts, residual plateau heuristics, stencil symmetry audits, duplication similarity, microbenchmark kernels, failure injection harness, multi‑objective tuner placeholders.
Outcome: Sandbox validated ideas before core integration.

## 06. Environment Stabilization ([OPS])
Actions: Ensured minimal dependable stack (Python 3.13, numpy, PyYAML, nbformat, pytest). Created curated `pytest.ini` with markers & JUnit XML output.
Outcome: Reproducible test harness foundation.

## 07. Red‑Team Reality Check ([RED][RISK])
User requested harsh critique (“fix all critiques”).
Findings:
- Synthetic physics (interpolation / non‑physical residuals) risked false confidence.
- Lack of manufactured solution gates for PDE correctness.
- Absence of provenance / run uniqueness; potential cross‑project log confusion.
Mitigations enumerated; prioritized manufactured Poisson & diffusion, residual definitions, gating.

## 08. Manufactured Poisson Solve ([PHYS][TEST])
Actions:
- Implemented `poisson_manufactured_test.py` (Jacobi w/ damping) for u=sin(pi x) sin(pi y) with correct sign convention.
- Added per‑pair L2 observed order computation & CI gate (order threshold + residual threshold).
- Output JSON: `poisson_ms_results.json` + perf metrics file.
Outcome: First objective physics correctness gate (approx 2nd order convergence verified).

## 09. Core Framework Modules ([CORE])
Introduced `framework/` package:
- `state.py`: Mesh & SolverState dataclasses.
- `config.py`: Flattened dotted-key schema + validation.
- `residuals.py`: Laplacian + diffusion residual (L2/Linf) (later continuity & momentum placeholders added).
- `diffusion_driver.py`: Explicit diffusion step (transient playground).
- `steady_diffusion.py`: Steady solver (Jacobi & SOR) for -Lap(u)=f/nu.
- `synthetic_guard.py`: Environment kill switch for synthetic paths.
- `projection_solver.py`: Fractional-step skeleton (later minimally implemented).
Outcome: Modular backbone for iterative physics enhancement.

## 10. Diffusion Convergence & SOR Acceleration ([PHYS][PERF][TEST])
Actions:
- Replaced fragile transient diffusion convergence check with steady manufactured solve.
- Implemented SOR path; test asserting SOR iteration count < 70% of Jacobi.
- Added iteration sanity cap & marked slow test.
Outcome: Verified spatial order and introduced first performance comparative metric.

## 11. Test Curation & CI Artifacts ([TEST][GOV])
Actions:
- Curated active tests: config/state/residual sanity, diffusion convergence, SOR speed, Poisson gate, Poisson perf metrics.
- Added JUnit XML output (`pytest_reports/junit.xml`).
- `TESTS_OVERVIEW.md` clarifying curated vs legacy sprawl.
Outcome: Clean, enforceable, machine‑parsable quality signals.

## 12. Performance Metrics Enrichment ([PERF])
Actions:
- Extended perf metrics to include error norms (L2/Linf) + monotonic iteration flag.
- Added test verifying presence & basic integrity.
Outcome: Baseline dataset for future regression gating.

## 13. Projection Solver Minimal Implementation ([PHYS][CORE])
Actions:
- Implemented diffusion‑only predictor, simple central divergence RHS, pressure Poisson via steady diffusion (nu=1) with SOR, velocity correction.
- Feature flag `PROJECTION_ENABLE` enforced.
- Test ensuring flag block + divergence reduction when enabled.
Outcome: Concrete starting point for incompressible pipeline; avenues for advection & CFL control.

## 14. Residual Extensions ([PHYS][CORE])
Added `continuity_residual` and `momentum_residual` placeholders for future Navier–Stokes validation gating.

## 15. Packaging & Documentation ([PKG][DOC])
Actions: Added `pyproject.toml` (pinned deps) and `README.md` (components, quick start, roadmap).
Outcome: Steps toward distributable / reproducible package identity.

## 16. Provenance & Structured Run Logging ([LOG][RISK])
Problem: Identical log lines across sibling CFD projects creating ambiguity.
Actions:
- Introduced `framework/logging.py`: run UUID, project name (env `PROJECT_NAME` override), date-parted directory, git SHA capture, meta JSON + JSONL events.
- Integrated into Poisson manufactured script (grid_complete & suite_complete events, CI gate status).
- Added test creating two runs ensuring distinct run directories & required keys.
Outcome: Clear run differentiation, enabling cross-project disambiguation & reproducibility auditing.

## 17. Conversation Log Centralization ([DOC][OPS])
Issue: Duplicate `conversation_log.md` copies across projects causing confusion.
Actions: Created `conversation_logs/` central directory; relocated canonical log; replaced original with pointer stub.
Outcome: Single source of truth for session knowledge.

## 18. Risk Register (Active Highlights) ([RISK])
- Physics fidelity: Projection lacks advection & proper pressure BCs → Prioritize adding stable advection & verifying divergence norms across time steps.
- Performance: Jacobi baseline slow for larger grids → Introduce multigrid or better SOR tuning & iteration regression gate.
- Regressions: Metrics collected but not yet gated vs baseline → Implement baseline snapshot & diff test.
- Supply chain: No hash pin / SBOM → Add lock snapshot + optional integrity verification script.
- Provenance scope: Only Poisson script instrumented → Extend logger to projection & diffusion paths.

## 19. Pending / Next High-Impact Tasks
1. Advection term & CFL time step adaptation (projection predictor upgrade).
2. Baseline performance regression gating (store golden metrics JSON; compare iterations/time per DoF).
3. Multigrid pressure solver integration (iteration reduction & scalability).
4. Enhanced residual suite (continuity & momentum norms tracked each projection step; divergence gate).
5. SBOM & dependency hash snapshot (`pip freeze` + SHA256 aggregated hash).
6. Structured configuration hashing & injection into run meta for reproducibility claims.
7. Golden manufactured solution expansions (variable coefficient Poisson, alternate analytic modes) for broader second‑order confirmation.
8. Logging extension: unify solver step events (residual, iteration, dt) into JSONL.

## 20. Key Decisions Recap
- Commit early to manufactured solutions as correctness gate before feature proliferation.
- Use simple SOR + Jacobi initially; postpone complexity (multigrid) until gating harness stable.
- Introduce provenance before broad performance optimization to ensure comparability.
- Centralize conversation knowledge to avoid silent drift between parallel projects.

## 21. Metrics & Quality Gates Snapshot
Current enforced gates:
- Poisson: pairwise L2 order threshold (default 1.8), finest residual < tol.
- Diffusion: min observed order > 1.5; SOR vs Jacobi iteration ratio < 0.7; iteration cap sanity.
- Projection: divergence reduction (single step) with feature flag control.
Pending gates (planned): performance regression vs baseline; continuity & momentum residual caps; run provenance completeness (fields present) test; multigrid iteration ceiling.

## 22. Provenance Schema (Current)
run_meta.json keys: project_name, run_id, timestamp_utc, cwd, python_version, platform, git_sha (optional), env_project_name, argv, config_hash.
events.jsonl per line: ts, level, project, run_id, msg (+ grid/error/residual fields per event).

## 23. Open Questions / Design TODOs
- Pressure BC generalization strategy (Dirichlet vs Neumann mix) for projection step.
- Field storage layout for cache efficiency (AoS vs SoA) when extending to 3D / MPI.
- Path to adaptive mesh or multi-resolution while preserving manufactured gating.
- Logging volume control (event sampling) for long transient runs.

## 24. Summary Statement
The project progressed from opaque, synthetic scaffolding toward a verifiable physics kernel with reproducible tests, structured provenance, and an extensible framework poised for higher-fidelity incompressible flow implementation and performance scaling. Remaining work concentrates on broadening physics (advection, robust pressure solves), instituting regression performance gates, and strengthening reproducibility (dependency integrity, expanded logging coverage).

## Appendix A: Detailed Phase Narratives & Artifacts (Expanded)

### A1. Forensic Scan Internals
- Inputs: Root workspace path, recursion depth unlimited, ignore patterns: none (initially).
- Methods: os.walk traversal, file classification by extension heuristic, optional nbformat import guarded try/except.
- Metrics Captured: total_files, code_files, text_files, notebook_files, aggregate line counts (approx, naive newline split), size histogram seeds.
- Output Artifacts: `workspace_full_inventory.json` (fields: path, ext, size_bytes, kind, line_estimate).
- Acceptance Criteria: 100% traversal without exceptions aborting run; no fatal on unreadable notebooks.
- Follow‑ups: Add extension taxonomy & language detection (deferred).

### A2. Analytics Layer Construction
- Feature Extraction: token frequency, function name harvesting via regex (def\s+NAME\(), TF‑IDF vectorization placeholder (stored index for future similarity queries).
- Dependency Hints: naive import line parsing ("import X" / "from X import"), aggregated into adjacency list.
- Knowledge Base Use Cases: duplicate detection candidate list, oversight on large unreferenced modules.
- Follow‑ups: Proper AST parsing + call graph (deferred).

### A3. Workflow Planning Refinements
- Iteration Counts: Base + 20 refinements (added gate specificity, ordering, risk tie‑ins) + 100 micro items (granular tasks: add type hints, isolate solver kernels, etc.).
- Planning Dimensions: (Scope, Value, Effort, Risk) annotated in later refinements (not yet codified in data file – future improvement).
- Governance Hooks: phase exit criteria (e.g., Physics Hardening exit requires manufactured Poisson & Diffusion order >=1.8, residual < tol).

### A4. Educational Track
- Chapter Skeletons: each with learning objectives, prerequisites, suggested exercises (placeholders for code cells).
- Intent: onboard new contributors rapidly; ensure conceptual debt minimized.
- Future: integrate with doctests & executed notebooks for reproducibility (deferred).

### A5. Experimental Playground Scripts
- Scripts (sample categories): adaptive_dt prototype, residual plateau classifier, stencil symmetry audit, duplication similarity (embedding distance threshold), microbench kernel (Laplacian vs vectorized), failure injection harness, multi‑objective tuner stub.
- Goal: Prove or discard ideas before core integration to avoid polluting production modules.
- Outcome: Informed adoption (e.g., plateau heuristic needed parameterization; not yet production).

### A6. Environment Stabilization
- Decision: Minimal deps to reduce supply chain surface early (numpy, PyYAML, nbformat, pytest).
- Pytest Config: `--junitxml` adds CI parseability, `markers.slow` distinguishes heavier convergence tests.
- Improvement Opportunity: Add coverage measurement & fail threshold (deferred).

### A7. Red‑Team Critique Highlights
- Findings Severity: High (synthetic physics risk), Medium (missing provenance), Medium (test brittleness), Low (naming inconsistencies).
- Immediate Mitigations Implemented: Manufactured solution gates, synthetic kill switch, test curation.
- Deferred Mitigations: Security hardening (hash pinning, SBOM), advanced performance gates.

### A8. Manufactured Poisson Solve Details
- Discretization: 5‑point Laplacian, uniform grid, Dirichlet boundaries from analytic solution.
- Solver: Damped Jacobi (omega configurable, default 1.0).
- Convergence Gate: pairwise L2 order > threshold (default 1.8) and finest grid Linf residual < tol.
- Metrics Files: `poisson_ms_results.json` (full results), `poisson_perf_metrics.json` (iterations, runtime, residual, errors, monotonic flag).
- Observed Orders Typical: 1.95–2.02 (depending on grids & floating rounding).

### A9. Core Framework Modules Rationale
- Separation: `state` (data), `config` (validation), `residuals` (physics imbalance), `steady_diffusion` (elliptic solver), `projection_solver` (incompressible pipeline scaffold), `logging` (later added).
- Principles: Fail fast on invalid config, explicit feature flags, minimal global state.

### A10. Diffusion Convergence & SOR
- Manufactured Solution: u = sin(pi x) sin(pi y) with source scaled by 2*pi^2*nu.
- Convergence Measurement: Grid list [17,33,65]; L2 error per grid; pairwise order log ratio.
- SOR Speed Metric: iteration_ratio = (SOR iters)/(Jacobi iters); gate future < 0.7 (currently asserted).

### A11. Test Suite Evolution
- Removed brittle constructs (manual malformed solver function) in favor of unified steady solver.
- Added iteration sanity cap (guard runaway divergence silently passing order test due to early exit wrong scenario).
- Marked slow tests to allow selective CI tiers.

### A12. Performance Metrics Enrichment
- Added error norms & monotonic iteration check; rationale: detection of pathological solver scaling or hidden coarse-grid anomalies.
- Future Plan: Add derived metric iteration_per_unknown = iters / (nx*ny) for scale invariance.

### A13. Projection Solver Minimal Implementation
- Predictor: diffusion-only forward Euler (no advection) to bootstrap pipeline.
- Pressure Solve: repurposed steady diffusion as Poisson with nu=1; solves -Lap(p)=f.
- Divergence Metric: Linf divergence post-correction logged; test ensures reduction from initial field.
- Limitations: Lack of consistent pressure boundary conditions; no advection; time integration simplistic.

### A14. Residual Extensions
- continuity_residual: central difference divergence on interior.
- momentum_residual: diffusion + pressure gradient only (no advection, forcing) → placeholder magnitude detectors.

### A15. Packaging & Documentation
- `pyproject.toml` defines minimal project metadata & dependencies; editable install pattern recommended during rapid iteration.
- README enumerates components and concise roadmap.
- Future: Add classifiers, long description auto‑sync, release automation stub.

- Events Captured: grid completion, suite completion, CI gate result.
- Extensibility: logger API supports arbitrary `extra` dict injection.
- Next: Add projection & diffusion solver step events; compute stable hash of key source files.

### A17. Conversation Log Centralization
- Motivation: Avoid diverging parallel logs creating audit ambiguity.
- Implementation: Moved file + stub pointer; added canonical appendix (this).
