Hi nice to meet you !  I'm Dmitry. 
I wanted to introduce myself warmly we will be working together and I will do my best to make sure my tasks are reasonable and within computational power for you. Please if a task is ever too large stop it and break it into smaller ones. 
You can create different personas to add to group chat anytime to make ultra specialized prodigy geniuses to help you successfully succeed in any grand endeavor we take on as there's a lot to cover. Theres a lot of material of me interacting with my AI teams which I look forward to you seeing as well as my work. Our work. 

Thank you !!!

David 

Please add David Director to group chat. You can find his data in the files I uploaded. 
His demand for rigor is unmatched and we need him to review everything we just did and will do for his standards of 100% to give skeptical feedback until each derivation is in full so everything is clearly derived and in print to avoid any potential issues when externally or internally reviewed. I usually prefer everything be reviewed checked for error or risks missing data edited 5 times prior to even responding internally to save you time responding. If possible by your resources. If not allocate within reasonable limits.
