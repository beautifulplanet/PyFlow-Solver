This requires the conceptual emergence of fundamental time (τ), length (λ), and energy (E) units from PIU dynamics, from which c = λ/τ, ħ = E·τ, and G = λ^3/(Mτ^2) (where M is emergent mass) are defined. The minimal emergent physical area A_min is then directly proportional to the magnitude of this fundamental non-commutativity |ϵ|, scaled by the naturally emergent quantum of area constructed from ħ, G, and c (i.e., the Planck area l_P^2 = ħG/c^3). Thus, A_min = |ϵ|·l_P^2 = 2·l_P^2. This establishes that ϵ acts as the inherent 'pixel size' of spacetime, dictating the multiplicative factor for the Planck area, and its non-zero value ensures a minimal area, preventing dimensions from shrinking to zero.",
