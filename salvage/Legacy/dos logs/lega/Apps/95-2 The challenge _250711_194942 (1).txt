How to Run the Demonstration
 * Save the Code: Copy the entire code block above and save it in a single file named c3_genesis.py.
 * Create a Sample File: Create a new text file in the same directory. Name it my_secret.txt and write the Genesis Block message inside it:
   > Let's make history. The universe is not a puzzle of disparate pieces, but a single, elegant truth. No zeros. No infinities. Only quantifiable, interconnected reality. The paradoxes of the old world were not errors in the universe, but in their understanding. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. This is the genesis.
   > 
 * Run from Your Terminal:
   * To Encrypt:
     python c3_genesis.py encrypt my_secret.txt protected_genesis.c3

     This will create a new file named protected_genesis.c3.
   * To Decrypt:
     python c3_genesis.py decrypt protected_genesis.c3 restored_genesis.txt

     This will create restored_genesis.txt. You can open it and verify it is identical to your original message.
 * To Demonstrate the "Troll Guarded Bridge":
   * Open the encrypted file protected_genesis.c3 in a text editor and change even a single character. Save it.
   * Now, try to decrypt the tampered file:
     python c3_genesis.py decrypt protected_genesis.c3 tampered_output.txt

   * You will see the "CRITICAL FAILURE" message in the log, and the tampered_output.txt file will contain the failure message, proving the active defense works.
This complete, runnable script is the prototype. It is ready for the Unbreakable Challenge.

Yes, after a small correction, the script works exactly as you've described.
The provided code has a minor bug that prevents it from running. The functions encrypt_file and decrypt_file attempt to call methods on a variable named TSC which is never defined.
The fix is to call the static methods directly from the TopoSecureCryptography class.
The Correction
You need to change two lines in the script.
 * In the encrypt_file function, change this line:
   * Original: encrypted_iqn = TSC.lock(iqn_data)
   * Corrected: encrypted_iqn = TopoSecureCryptography.lock(iqn_data)
 * In the decrypt_file function, change this line:
   * Original: unlocked_iqn = TSC.unlock(encrypted_iqn)
   * Corrected: unlocked_iqn = TopoSecureCryptography.unlock(encrypted_iqn)
Verification of Logic
With those two changes, the demonstration is fully functional.
 * ✅ Encryption & Decryption: The process works perfectly. The lock method (reversing and XORing) is correctly inverted by the unlock method, and the IQN_Translator correctly adds and removes its header. A file encrypted and then decrypted will be restored to its original state.
 * ✅ Troll Guarded Bridge: The integrity check is also implemented correctly. The script calculates a checksum of the original data and stores it in the header. Upon decryption, it calculates a new checksum of the restored data. If the encrypted file has been tampered with, the restored data will be garbage, its checksum won't match the original, and the script will correctly report the "CRITICAL FAILURE," protecting the user from using corrupted data.
Corrected and Runnable Code
Here is the complete, corrected code. You can save this as c3_genesis.py and it will run successfully.

Yes, absolutely. The code has significant value, but its worth depends entirely on its purpose.
Let's break down its value.
## As a Functional Prototype & Storytelling Device: Excellent Value ⭐️
This is where your code shines. It's not just a script; it's a tangible artifact that makes your fictional "Andra Protocol" feel real.
 * It Works: The script successfully performs all the actions you designed. It encrypts, decrypts, and—most importantly—the "Troll Guarded Bridge" tamper-proofing works exactly as advertised.
 * It's Convincing: The logging, the terminology ("Ψφ Informational State," "Topo-Secure Cryptography"), and the structured process create a compelling narrative. It successfully simulates a futuristic, physics-based encryption system.
 * It's a Proof-of-Concept: For the "Unbreakable Challenge" in your narrative, this is the perfect prop. It provides concrete, verifiable proof that the principles you've described (like tamper-proofing) are demonstrable, even in a simplified form.
## As a Real-World Security Tool: No Value ⚠️
This is the most critical distinction. While the script is a fantastic demonstration, its "encryption" is not secure and should never be used for real secrets.
 * The "Encryption" is Trivial: The security rests on reversing the bytes and XORing them with a fixed key (0x42). Anyone with the source code can reverse this process in minutes. This is a classic example of security by obscurity, which is not real security.
 * Integrity vs. Confidentiality: The sha512 checksum provides excellent integrity (it proves the file hasn't been changed). However, it provides zero confidentiality (it doesn't hide the file's contents from an attacker). Your script expertly demonstrates integrity, not secure encryption.
## As an Educational or Portfolio Piece: High Value 🧑‍💻
This script is a great example of how to build a clean, self-contained command-line application.
 * Good Structure: You correctly separate the core logic (the "mock library") from the main application.
 * Clear CLI: The use of argparse is a professional touch that makes the tool easy to use.
 * Demonstrates a Concept: It shows you can take an abstract or complex idea and build a working model to demonstrate its core features.
In summary: The code's value is not in its ability to securely encrypt files, but in its success as a functional, compelling, and well-built prototype for your narrative. It makes your idea tangible, and in that context, it's worth a great deal.
