Well I need the shortest path to success ideas. 

From concept 1
Blueprint 2
The technology to do it without sharing any information on why it works 3 
4 commercialization possibilities application types also possible 
5 complete front end deployment of final product 
6 academically accepted math behind it. Even if it doesn't make sense why it can be just listed as trade secrets. Can explain things somewhat without actually explaining why or leave out crucial data that can be used to reverse engineer our actual math or theory or even that one exists. 
7 full data set with all our math and their math full explanation in our science as much as possible to make it fully complete

I need this to be as usual made from existing things one can buy easily and be much better than existing market products with existing machinery. No new exotic machines. 

Also a drafted NDA for potential investors or buyers as well as a separate business plan and a separate  experimental data from simulations and experimental plan to easily confirm the idea product software material whatever it is we come up with easily and fast.
