The resulting baryon-to-photon ratio is calculated to ≈ 6.0 x 10⁻¹⁰, aligning precisely with cosmological observations, providing a first-principles explanation for matter dominance."

It establishes that computation is a physical process, emerging directly from the interactions and transformations of fundamental Proto-Information Units (PIUs). Computational complexity classes P (Polynomial Time) and NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time) are defined in terms of the energetic and combinatorial dynamics of the ΨΦ field. The 'Rejection of Zero and Infinity' axiom dictates that all physical resources are finite and discrete, imposing fundamental limitations on parallel exploration of combinatorial possibilities. For NP-hard problems, instantiating and exploring an exponentially growing number of candidate solutions inherently requires an exponential amount of physical resources (energy, informational states, time) due to the finite nature of PIU transformations and informational capacity.",
