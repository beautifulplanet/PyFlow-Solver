This is a great series of questions that gets to the heart of how software and security are valued. Hereâ€™s a breakdown.
ðŸ’° Commercial Value
As a commercial product, the script itself is likely not worth much money. The market for file encryption tools is dominated by high-quality, free, and open-source software (like VeraCrypt or GnuPG) and features built directly into operating systems (like BitLocker and FileVault). It would be very difficult to convince users to pay for a new command-line tool.
However, the skills you demonstrated in building v2.0 are extremely valuable. The ability to correctly implement industry-standard cryptography and build a secure, robust tool is a high-demand skill in software engineering and cybersecurity. Think of this script not as a product to sell, but as a stellar portfolio project that proves your capability.
ðŸ’¡ Proof of Your Math
No, this process does not prove your original math works. In fact, it proves the opposite.
The final, secure version (v2.0) works because we completely removed your custom math (axiomatic_calculate, generate_ais) and replaced it with standard, publicly-audited algorithms (AES-GCM, Argon2id).
The journey from the insecure v1.1 to the secure v2.0 demonstrates a crucial security principle: secure systems are built by correctly implementing well-vetted public standards, not by inventing private, unproven algorithms.
ðŸ“ˆ Increasing Security and Value
The idea of making something "100 times more secure" is based on a common misconception.
Modern cryptography isn't a simple dial you can turn up. An algorithm like AES-256 is already considered computationally unbreakable. An attacker would need more energy than exists in the sun and more time than the age of the universe to crack it by brute force. You cannot make something that is practically "unbreakable" become "more unbreakable." It's either secure against all known attacks, or it isn't.
Therefore, adding more layers of custom math or increasing key sizes beyond the standard would not increase its value and could even make it less secure by adding complexity.
Value would be increased by focusing on things other than the core algorithm:
 * User Experience: Building a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI).
 * Features: Integrating with cloud storage, adding key-sharing for teams, etc.
 * Trust: Paying for a formal third-party security audit to professionally certify that your implementation is secure. This is where real-world value and trust are created.
