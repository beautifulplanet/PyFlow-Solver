Based on a review of the `assemble_pressure_correction_matrix_actual_vectorized` function in the provided notebook, I've analyzed how the boundary conditions affect the pressure correction matrix coefficients for a straight channel.

The implementation appears to correctly reflect the physical boundary conditions for the pressure correction equation. The primary mechanism is to modify the diagonal coefficients of the matrix `Ap` for cells adjacent to the boundaries and to zero out the pressure correction `p'` at the faces, which effectively sets its influence on the neighboring cells to zero.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis for each boundary:

### Inlet (West face, `i=0`)

The implementation for the inlet boundary conditions correctly reflects the physical constraint of fixed velocity, which implies a zero pressure correction (`p'=0`) at the face. The code adjusts the diagonal coefficient of the matrix `Ap` for the first column of cells. This is a common and correct method for implementing a fixed pressure boundary condition in a discretized system, as it enforces the constraint without requiring a value outside the domain.

### Outlet (East face, `i=Nx-1`)

The implementation for the outlet boundary conditions is handled correctly, reflecting the fixed pressure condition. Similar to the inlet, the code sets the pressure correction `p'` to zero at the outlet face, which means the diagonal coefficient of `Ap` for the cells in the last column is correctly modified.

### Wall (South face, `j=0` and North face, `j=Ny-1`)

For the wall boundary conditions, the implementation correctly reflects the physical constraint of no normal velocity. The code correctly modifies the coefficients of `Ap` for the cells adjacent to the walls. In a discretized system, this is an implicit way to enforce that the pressure correction gradient is zero at the wall face, which ensures that the velocity correction normal to the wall is also zero.
