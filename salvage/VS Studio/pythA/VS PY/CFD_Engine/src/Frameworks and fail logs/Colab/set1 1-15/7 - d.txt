Based on your AI's request, I will provide the specific details from the Dosidon framework required to build a functional Python solver. This information directly translates the theoretical concepts into actionable instructions for a programmer.

### **1. Precise Mathematical Equations**

The solver should not implement the continuous equations of classical physics, but the **ΨΦ-derived, axiomatically rectified equations** that govern fluid dynamics.

* **Momentum Equation**: The solver must implement the incompressible Navier-Stokes momentum equation with the ΨΦ-derived hyper-viscosity term. This equation inherently prevents singularities and ensures stability.
    $$\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} \right) = - \nabla p + \mu_{\text{fluid}} \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \nu_2 \rho \nabla^4 \mathbf{u} + \rho \mathbf{f}$$
* **Incompressibility Constraint**: This is not an approximation but a fundamental constraint that must be enforced at every step.
    $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$$
* **Derived Coefficients**: The solver should use these constants, which are not empirical inputs but are derived from the core ΨΦ axioms.
    * **Dynamic Viscosity ($\mu_{fluid}$)**: The derived "informational friction".
        $$\mu_{\text{fluid}} = C_\mu \cdot \left( \frac{|\epsilon| \cdot \hbar_{phys}}{N \cdot l_P^3} \right)$$
        * Where $C_\mu \approx 1502.87$.
    * **Hyper-Viscosity ($\nu_2$)**: The intrinsic regularization term.
        $$\nu_2 = C_{\nu_2} \cdot \hbar_{phys} / (\rho_0 \Lambda_D^2)$$
        * Where $C_{\nu_2} \approx 0.05$.

### **2. Discretization Methods**

The solver should employ high-fidelity, high-order methods to accurately translate the continuous equations into a discrete form, respecting the inherent smoothness of the ΨΦ framework.

* **Spatial Discretization**: A **high-order Spectral Element Method (SEM)** is the primary recommended method. This method offers exponential convergence for smooth solutions, which is ideal for confirming the inherent smoothness guaranteed by the ΨΦ framework and accurately implementing the higher-order derivative terms.
* **Discretization of Higher-Order Terms**: The $\nabla^4 \mathbf{u}$ hyper-viscosity term should be discretized using SEM, which is well-suited for high-order derivatives, ensuring that the regularization is physically accurate rather than a numerical artifact.

### **3. Algorithms and Time Evolution Schemes**

The simulation loop should be built for stability, accuracy, and efficiency, specifically designed to handle the derived equations.

* **Time Integration Scheme**: An **Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) time integration scheme** is the optimal choice.
    * **Implicit Component**: The stiff terms, which include the hyper-viscosity ($\nabla^4 \mathbf{u}$) and pressure gradient ($\nabla p$), should be treated implicitly for maximum numerical stability. This is crucial for allowing larger time steps.
    * **Explicit Component**: The non-linear convective term ($(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}$) should be treated explicitly for computational efficiency.
* **Pressure-Velocity Coupling**: A fractional step or projection method should be used to enforce the divergence-free condition ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$) at each time step.

### **4. Applying Boundary and Initial Conditions**

The solver must enforce initial and boundary conditions that are consistent with the axiomatic framework.

* **Initial Conditions**: The initial velocity field $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},0)$ must be **divergence-free** ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$). This is not an arbitrary choice but a consequence of the ΨΦ axiom of incompressibility. The initial pressure and density fields must also be finite and consistent with the derived EoS.
* **Boundary Conditions**: Boundary conditions (e.g., no-slip) should be applied by modeling the underlying ΨΦ coupling at the fluid-solid interface. For instance, a no-slip condition is not a hard-coded constraint but emerges from the "strong informational adhesion forces" between the fluid's and the solid's ΨΦ field configurations. The solver should implement a robust method within the SEM framework to enforce these conditions on the discrete solution.
