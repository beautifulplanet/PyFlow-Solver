Based on the code you provided in the `pycfdflow2_v2 (1).py` file, the `IndentationError` occurs because the `def run_simulation(...)` line is incorrectly indented. It is currently inside the `Solver` class, where it does not belong.

The fix is to **unindent** the `run_simulation` function so it is defined at the top level of the script, completely outside of the `Solver` class.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected structure. Apply this change to your file.

```python
# ... (Code for Grid, Core, and Solver classes remains here) ...

class Solver:
    """
    Main solver class for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
    """
    def __init__(self, grid, rho, nu):
        # ... (contents of __init__) ...

    def set_boundary_conditions(self):
        # ... (contents of set_boundary_conditions) ...
    
    # ... (other methods of the Solver class like solve_momentum_predictor) ...

# CORRECTED: This function must be unindented to be outside the Solver class.
def run_simulation(Nx, Ny, Lx, Ly, rho, nu, dt, total_time):
    """
    Sets up and runs the Lid-Driven Cavity simulation.
    """
    # ... (contents of run_simulation) ...

# The main execution block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_simulation(Nx=100, Ny=100, Lx=1.0, Ly=1.0, rho=1.0, nu=0.01, dt=0.001, total_time=0.1)

```

This is a fundamental syntax rule in Python. The indentation level defines the scope of classes and functions. Clean, correct indentation is not optional. Fix it and proceed.
