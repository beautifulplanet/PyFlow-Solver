Based on your request to proceed with "Option 2" (several consolidated JSON files), I will outline a conceptual structure for how you can organize the information from the files you've provided into logical categories. As an AI, I cannot directly create or manage local files on your system, but I can provide the schema and content guidance for these consolidated JSON files, which you can then implement yourself.
Here's how you can organize the information into several consolidated JSON files:
Proposed Consolidated JSON Files Structure
I recommend grouping the information into the following thematic JSON files:
 * psi_phi_core_theory.json: This file would contain the foundational principles of the ΨΦ Unified Field Theory.
   * Content Scope: Theory overview, fundamental axioms (Proto-Information Units, Rejection of Zero and Infinity), derived fundamental constants (ε=-2, N=16, \\hbar\_{phys}, c\_{phys}), and the emergence of the ΨΦ field and spacetime.
   * Example Content Reference: Information from files like "150 1 full new_250715_225006.txt", "140 the science _250715_133713 (1).txt", "160 ( 151 json )_250716_110357.txt", and the abstract in "165 toe abstract.txt".

  "theory_name": "ΨΦ Unified Field Theory: Cosmic Numbers Unified Phi-Field Model",
  "abstract": "This document presents the ΨΦ Unified Field Theory, an axiomatically-grounded scientific framework proposed as a candidate Theory of Everything. Rooted in the fundamental properties of non-commutative Proto-Information Units (PIUs) and a principle of absolute finitude (\"Rejection of Zero and Infinity\"), ΨΦ rigorously derives all known fundamental forces, particles, spacetime, and cosmological phenomena as emergent properties of a single underlying field. This paper synthesizes the explicit mathematical derivations and validations for the theory's most critical quantitative predictions, which directly address long-standing unsolved problems in physics. These include the unification of fundamental couplings, the resolution of the Muon g-2 anomaly, the prediction of Dark Matter's interaction cross-section, the solution to the Yang-Mills Mass Gap problem, and the guaranteed smoothness of fluid dynamics. ΨΦ provides a comprehensive, internally consistent, and, crucially, falsifiable framework for understanding reality, setting a new standard for testable theories of everything.",

How to Implement This Yourself
 * Create New Files: Create four new .json files with the suggested names (e.g., psi_phi_core_theory.json, psi_phi_problem_resolutions.json, etc.).
 * Copy and Paste Content: For each file, copy the corresponding JSON structure and content (as provided in the examples above) into the respective file.
 * Validate JSON: Use an online JSON validator or a code editor with JSON validation (like VS Code) to ensure that each file is correctly formatted JSON.
 * Load in Future: In the future, you can load these individual JSON files into your programs or environments as needed. For example, in Python:
   import json

with open('psi_phi_core_theory.json', 'r') as f:
    core_theory_data = json.load(f)

with open('psi_phi_problem_resolutions.json', 'r') as f:
    problem_resolutions_data = json.load(f)

# ... and so on for other files

# Now you have all your data organized in Python variables
print(core_theory_data["theory_name"])

This approach provides a clear, organized, and manageable way to store your extensive documentation while mitigating the risks associated with a single, very large file.
