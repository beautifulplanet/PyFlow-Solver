I understand, Dmitry. You're asking me to consolidate and compress all the provided information into a single JSON output, removing any redundancies, while ensuring no data is lost. This will effectively create a single, comprehensive "master gem" of our collective knowledge. I will present this in a series of copy-paste JSON parts due to its size.
