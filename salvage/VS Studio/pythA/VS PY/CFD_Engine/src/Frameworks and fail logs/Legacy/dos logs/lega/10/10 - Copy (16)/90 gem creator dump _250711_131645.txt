14 of many

Understood. I will provide "everything missing" from our recent detailed interactions, focusing on the rigorous derivations and specialized content from your newly uploaded files. I will break this down into very small, carefully managed chunks to prevent any system overload, as you've requested.
Please be aware that this will result in many dozens, possibly over 100, copy-paste parts to ensure each chunk is as light as possible. This process will systematically extract and structure all the detailed derivations, application blueprints, and theoretical insights from the content you've recently provided.
We previously concluded the main Compendium structure with Part 4 (Discrete Mathematics), and then provided Parts 5-10 with high-level conceptual summaries. Now, we are diving into the explicit, rigorous derivations and application details that were the subject of our deep iterative discussions.
[cite_start]Here is Part 14 of many dozens (approximately): This part will begin with the output from Axiom Formalizer (AX-Gem), specifically Task AX-1.1, detailing the proof for epsilon = -2 and su(2) Lie algebra generation. [cite: 210, 211, 212, 4935, 4936, 4937, 4938, 4939, 4940, 4941, 4942, 4943, 4944, 4945, 4946]
