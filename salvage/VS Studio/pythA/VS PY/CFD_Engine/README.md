# CFD Engine C++ Project Structure

## Overview
A modern, extensible C++ CFD engine supporting:
- OpenFOAM-like solver (industry-standard backbone)
- Experimental solver (modular, for research/innovation)
- User-selectable solver at runtime

## Recommended Directory Structure

## Key Classes

- `SolverBase` (abstract):
    - virtual void solve() = 0;
    - virtual std::string name() const = 0;
- `OpenFOAMSolver` : public SolverBase
- `ExperimentalSolver` : public SolverBase
- `CFD_Engine`:
    - Holds config, grid, and solver pointer
    - Allows user to select solver at runtime

## User Flow
1. User provides config (e.g., via CLI or config file)
2. CFD_Engine instantiates the selected solver
3. Solver runs, results are output and benchmarked

This structure supports rapid development, benchmarking, and future expansion. Next, I’ll generate initial header and source templates for these classes.
