PyFlow CFD Benchmark Test Failure Report
========================================

Date: August 25, 2025

Summary:
--------
- The strict benchmark test for Re=400 fails due to non-finite (nan) values in the computed u_centerline.
- This indicates numerical instability or divergence in the solver for these parameters.

Details:
--------
- Test: test_benchmark_centerline[400]
- Failure: AssertionError: Non-finite values in u_centerline for Re=400
- Output: [ 0. nan nan ... nan 1.]
- dt: 0.0002, T: 10.0, NPOINTS: 65
- Reducing dt and T did not resolve the issue.

Possible Causes:
----------------
- Solver instability at higher Reynolds numbers (Re=400).
- Time step (dt) may still be too large, or the SIMPLE algorithm may need more robust stabilization.
- Boundary conditions or initial conditions may be causing divergence.
- Pressure-velocity coupling or discretization errors.

Recommendations:
----------------
- Add runtime checks for nan/inf in the solver and print diagnostics.
- Try further reducing dt or increasing the number of pressure iterations.
- Review and compare the solver implementation with reference SIMPLE solvers.
- Consult a CFD expert or advanced AI for numerical stabilization strategies.

Next Steps:
-----------
- See god_file.txt for a full export of all project files for external review.
- Engage the new AI persona (TestMaster) for advanced test and debugging strategy.
