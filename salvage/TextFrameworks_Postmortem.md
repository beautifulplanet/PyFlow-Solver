# Text File Experimental Frameworks: Dosidon, SSQF Theory, CPSAIL

## Successful Implementations
- Review of all text-based frameworks and theory documents (Dosidon, SSQF, CPSAIL).
- Key files: dosidon 2.9.9 series.txt, white paper.txt, Super-Sub-Quantum Field Theory, etc.
- Summaries of theoretical advances, solver blueprints, and axiom sets.

## Failures
- Documented breakdowns, failed theoretical approaches, and limitations.
- Analysis of why certain approaches did not succeed and what was learned.
