Of course. After a detailed review of your solver's code and the conversation history, I can confirm your diagnosis is correct. The persistent plateau in your residuals is a classic symptom of a subtle but critical bug in the boundary condition implementation.

You were right to suspect the simple zero-gradient extrapolation for the outlet velocity in the calculate_continuity_residual function. Hereâ€™s a deeper look at why that's the problem and how to fix it.

The Root Cause: Pressure-Velocity Decoupling at the Outlet
The core issue is an inconsistency between how your solver handles the velocity and the pressure at the outlet boundary.

The Pressure Condition: You've set a "zero gauge pressure" outlet. In the SIMPLE algorithm, this means the pressure correction (p') at the outlet must be zero. The solver is not allowed to adjust the pressure there.

The Velocity Condition: In your calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized function, the velocity at the outlet face is calculated with a simple extrapolation: u_face_e_star[:, -1] = u_star_field[:, -1].

The Conflict: This simple velocity extrapolation doesn't account for the fixed pressure condition. As a result, the mass flux calculated at the outlet creates a continuity error (a non-zero residual). The solver's natural response is to create a pressure correction (p') to fix this error. However, the boundary condition forbids any pressure correction at the outlet.

The solver is caught in a loop: it sees a mass imbalance, wants to fix it with pressure, but is not allowed to. This conflict prevents the continuity residual from ever reaching zero, causing the plateau you're observing. This is a form of pressure-velocity decoupling right at the boundary.

The Solution: Enforce Global Mass Conservation
Instead of a simple local extrapolation, the professional way to handle this is to enforce that the mass leaving the domain is exactly equal to the mass entering it.

The fix involves modifying the calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized function to perform a global mass flow correction. We will:

Calculate the total mass flux coming in through the inlet.

Calculate the total mass flux leaving the outlet based on the simple extrapolation.

Calculate the difference (the global mass imbalance).

Distribute this difference as a small correction to all the outlet face velocities, ensuring that mass_in = mass_out.

This approach makes the velocity field at the outlet consistent with the inlet conditions and the overall continuity equation, resolving the conflict and allowing the residuals to converge properly.

I've implemented this fix in an updated version of your solver code. This is a significant change, so I've placed it in a new document for clarity.
