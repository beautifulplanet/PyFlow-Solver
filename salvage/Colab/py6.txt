Yes, let's re-examine the boundary condition logic in `pyflow/solver.py`. Given that simpler fixes haven't worked, a detailed review of how the solver handles the boundaries for the straight channel case is the most logical next step.

Here are the relevant code sections from `pyflow/solver.py`, focusing on how the boundary conditions are implemented.

### **Boundary Condition Logic in `pyflow/solver.py`**

**`assemble_momentum_matrix_actual_with_diag_vectorized` function:**

```python
    # Inlet Boundary (West Face) - for i = 0 fluid cells
    i_inlet_cells = 0
    inlet_fluid_indices_y = np.where(is_fluid_cell[:, i_inlet_cells])[0]
    if inlet_fluid_indices_y.size > 0:
        # Pressure correction at the inlet boundary face is often set to 0
        # (consistent with fixed inlet velocity). This modifies the coefficient
        # for the West face contribution to Ap[cell_index, cell_index].
        # The coefficient for the face becomes related to (rho * Area_ew^2 / Au_P_cell) / dx
        # Corrected indexing for Au_diag
        inlet_cell_indices = cell_indices[inlet_fluid_indices_y, i_inlet_cells].flatten()
        Ap_nb_w_boundary = rho * grid.Area_ew * grid.Area_ew * (1.0 / Au_diag.reshape(n_cells_y, n_cells_x)[inlet_fluid_indices_y, i_inlet_cells]) / grid.dx
        Ap_diag_field[inlet_fluid_indices_y, i_inlet_cells] += Ap_nb_w_boundary


    # Outlet Boundary (East Face) - for i = n_cells_x - 1 fluid cells
    i_outlet_cells = n_cells_x - 1
    outlet_fluid_indices_y = np.where(is_fluid_cell[:, i_outlet_cells])[0]
    if outlet_fluid_indices_y.size > 0:
        # Pressure correction at the outlet boundary face is usually fixed to 0
        # (consistent with p=0 gauge BC). This modifies the diagonal coefficient.
        # Corrected indexing for Au_diag
        outlet_cell_indices = cell_indices[outlet_fluid_indices_y, i_outlet_cells].flatten()
        Ap_nb_e_boundary = rho * grid.Area_ew * grid.Area_ew * (1.0 / Au_diag.reshape(n_cells_y, n_cells_x)[outlet_fluid_indices_y, i_outlet_cells]) / grid.dx
        Ap_diag_field[outlet_fluid_indices_y, i_outlet_cells] += Ap_nb_e_boundary


    # Bottom Wall Boundary (South Face) - for j = 0 fluid cells
    j_bottom_wall_cells = 0
    bottom_wall_fluid_indices_x = np.where(is_fluid_cell[j_bottom_wall_cells, :])[0]
    if bottom_wall_fluid_indices_x.size > 0:
        # No mass flux through wall -> v'=0 at wall. Similar effect on diagonal as p'=0.
        # Coefficient related to (rho * Area_ns^2 / Av_P_cell) / dy
        # Corrected indexing for Av_diag
        bottom_wall_cell_indices = cell_indices[j_bottom_wall_cells, bottom_wall_fluid_indices_x].flatten()
        Ap_nb_s_boundary = rho * grid.Area_ns * grid.Area_ns * (1.0 / Av_diag.reshape(n_cells_y, n_cells_x)[j_bottom_wall_cells, bottom_wall_fluid_indices_x]) / grid.dy
        Ap_diag_field[j_bottom_wall_cells, bottom_wall_fluid_indices_x] += Ap_nb_s_boundary


    # Top Wall Boundary (North Face) - for j = n_cells_y - 1 fluid cells
    j_top_wall_cells = n_cells_y - 1
    top_wall_fluid_indices_x = np.where(is_fluid_cell[j_top_wall_cells, :])[0]
    if top_wall_fluid_indices_x.size > 0:
        # No mass flux through wall -> v'=0 at wall.
        # Corrected indexing for Av_diag
        top_wall_cell_indices = cell_indices[j_top_wall_cells, top_wall_fluid_indices_x].flatten()
        Ap_nb_n_boundary = rho * grid.Area_ns * grid.Area_ns * (1.0 / Av_diag.reshape(n_cells_y, n_cells_x)[j_top_wall_cells, top_wall_fluid_indices_x]) / grid.dy
        Ap_diag_field[j_top_wall_cells, top_wall_fluid_indices_x] += Ap_nb_n_boundary
```

**`calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized` function:**

```python
    # Inlet Boundary (i = 0 cells): Use specified inlet velocity
    inlet_y_indices = np.where(grid.y_cc[:, 0] <= grid.Ly_in + 1e-9)[0]
    u_face_w_star[inlet_y_indices, 0] = U_in # For cells within inlet height
    u_face_w_star[np.where(grid.y_cc[:, 0] > grid.Ly_in + 1e-9)[0], 0] = 0.0 # Wall above inlet

    Mass_w = rho * u_face_w_star * Area_ew


    # Outlet Boundary (i = n_cells_x - 1 cells): Assume zero gradient for velocity
    u_face_e_star[:, -1] = u_star_field[:, -1] # Simple extrapolation

    Mass_e = rho * u_face_e_star * Area_ew


    # Bottom Wall Boundary (j = 0 cells): No flow through wall (v=0)
    v_face_s_star[0, :] = 0.0

    Mass_s = rho * v_face_s_star * Area_ns


    # Top Wall Boundary (j = n_cells_y - 1 cells): No flow through wall (v=0)
    # Corrected logic: The top boundary is at j = n_cells_y - 1.
    # For cells at this top boundary row, the north face velocity is 0.
    v_face_n_star[-1, :] = 0.0
```

**`update_velocity_from_pressure_correction_vectorized` function:**

```python
    # Apply explicit boundary conditions after the general update (Vectorized)
    # Inlet BC: u = U_in (for applicable cells), v = 0
    inlet_y_indices = np.where(grid.y_cc[:, 0] <= grid.Ly_in + 1e-9)[0]
    u_corrected[inlet_y_indices, 0] = U_in
    v_corrected[inlet_y_indices, 0] = 0.0
    # Wall BCs: u=0, v=0
    u_corrected[0, :] = 0.0 # Bottom wall
    v_corrected[0, :] = 0.0
    u_corrected[grid.Ny_out - 1, :] = 0.0 # Top wall (full length) - Corrected index
    v_corrected[grid.Ny_out - 1, :] = 0.0 # Corrected index
```

### **Analysis and Next Steps**

Based on a detailed review of this logic, especially in the context of the simple straight channel benchmark where `Ly_in == Ly_out`:

1.  **Outlet Condition**: The simple velocity extrapolation `u_face_e_star[:, -1] = u_star_field[:, -1]` is a known source of instability and can prevent residuals from decreasing. A more robust outlet condition is needed.
2.  **Pressure Reference**: The pressure reference is hard-coded to the cell at index `[0,0]` (`Ap[0, 0] = 1.0`). While necessary, this can sometimes conflict with the physics if that cell experiences complex pressure changes.
3.  **Explicit vs. Implicit BCs**: The boundary conditions are applied both implicitly during matrix assembly (by modifying coefficients) and explicitly after the velocity update. This can sometimes lead to inconsistencies.

The most likely culprit preventing convergence to a tight tolerance is the **outlet boundary condition**. Let's try implementing a more physically sound outlet condition that enforces global mass conservation and see if it resolves the plateauing residuals in our benchmark test.
