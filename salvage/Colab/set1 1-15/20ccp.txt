I was unable to access the content of the file you uploaded.

To help you, please **paste the relevant Python code** from your `cpsail_c_prototype_ (2).py` file directly into the chat. I need to see the `TextRecognitionOperator` class and the `pytest` script you're using.

However, the problem "keeps not seeing text properly" is extremely common in OCR tasks. The issue is almost always a lack of **image preprocessing**. Raw images are often too "noisy" for an OCR engine like Tesseract to read accurately.

Here is a masterclass guide to fixing it.

-----

### \#\# Diagnosis and Solution

Your tests are likely failing because you are feeding a raw image directly into the OCR engine. You must clean the image first to make the text as clear as possible.

Here is the standard, professional workflow for robust text recognition.

### \#\#\# Step 1: Install OpenCV

If you haven't already, you'll need the premier library for image manipulation, OpenCV.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### \#\#\# Step 2: Implement a Preprocessing Pipeline

Before calling `pytesseract`, you must process the image. Here's a function that includes the most effective techniques.

```python
import cv2
import pytesseract

def preprocess_for_ocr(image_path: str):
    """
    Loads an image and applies a standard preprocessing pipeline
    to make it suitable for OCR.
    """
    # 1. Load the image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)

    # 2. Convert to Grayscale
    # Color information is not useful for OCR and can introduce noise.
    gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # 3. Apply Thresholding
    # This is the most critical step. It converts the image to pure
    # black and white, making the characters stand out.
    _, binary_image = cv2.threshold(gray_image, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)

    # 4. Apply a slight blur to remove noise
    # This removes small, random specks that can be mistaken for characters.
    denoised_image = cv2.medianBlur(binary_image, 3)

    return denoised_image
```

### \#\#\# Step 3: Update Your `TextRecognitionOperator`

Integrate this preprocessing pipeline into your operator class. You should also configure `pytesseract` to be more accurate.

```python
from PIL import Image # For opening the image
import pytesseract

# Assume the preprocess_for_ocr function from above is in this file

class CPSAIL_Vision:
    class TextRecognitionOperator:
        def __init__(self):
            # If tesseract is not in your system's PATH, you must specify it.
            # Example for Windows:
            # pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
            pass

        def execute(self, image_path: str) -> str:
            """
            Takes an image path, preprocesses the image, and extracts text.
            """
            # 1. Preprocess the image to make it clean for OCR
            clean_image = preprocess_for_ocr(image_path)

            # 2. Configure Tesseract for better accuracy
            # --psm 6 assumes a single uniform block of text.
            # This is one of the most common and effective settings.
            custom_config = r'--oem 3 --psm 6'

            # 3. Perform OCR on the CLEANED image
            try:
                extracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(clean_image, config=custom_config)
                return extracted_text.strip() # Use .strip() to remove leading/trailing whitespace
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"An error occurred during OCR: {e}")
                return ""
```

### \#\# Summary and Next Steps

Your tests are failing not because your logic is wrong, but because the real world (images) is messy. By adding a robust preprocessing pipeline, you are making the data clean and predictable, which is essential for reliable testing and functionality.

1.  **Integrate** the preprocessing code above.
2.  **Ensure** you have a simple, high-contrast image for your `pytest` script. A black-and-white PNG file with large, clear text is ideal for a unit test.
3.  **Rerun** your tests.

If they still fail, please **paste your updated code and the test image you are using**, and we can refine the preprocessing steps further.
