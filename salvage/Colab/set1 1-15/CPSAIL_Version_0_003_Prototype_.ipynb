The extracted text like `'oo'`, `'tm'`, and `'ane'` shows that Tesseract is seeing scattered shapes, not coherent letters.

The adaptive thresholding is creating blobs, the noise reduction might be warping the letters, and the minor rotations are making character alignment difficult for the OCR engine.

The extracted text indicates significant difficulty in correctly identifying the characters. This suggests that the combination of noise, rotation, and potentially font variations are still too challenging for the current approach. To further analyze and improve, I will try a different PSM configuration (PSM 11 - sparse text) to see if it can pick up any parts of the word in a less structured way, and I will also consider slightly different adaptive thresholding parameters again or explore adding a contrast adjustment step. Since the PSM 8 configuration was unsuccessful, I will revert to PSM 11 for this attempt.\n",

        "*   The initial `TextRecognitionOperator` failed to recognize the target word \"CPSAIL\" in any of the 5 generated real-world test images, resulting in 0 successful recognitions and 5 failed recognitions.\n",
        "*   Multiple attempts were made to enhance the `TextRecognitionOperator` by incorporating more advanced preprocessing techniques (median filtering, adaptive thresholding with different parameters) and experimenting with various Tesseract PSM configurations (PSM 7, PSM 8, PSM 11).\n",
        "*   Despite these refinements, the `TextRecognitionOperator` consistently failed to recognize the target word in all 5 real-world test images across all tested configurations.\n",
        "*   The conceptual framework was successfully expanded by defining abstract base classes `Operator` and `TestBench` with `execute` and `run_test` methods, respectively.\n",
        "*   A dataset of 5 real-world-like images containing the word \"CPSAIL\" with variations in font size, background color, minor rotation, and salt and pepper noise was successfully generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current preprocessing techniques and Tesseract configurations within the `TextRecognitionOperator` are not sufficient to handle the introduced variations in the real-world test data. Further research into more robust OCR preprocessing methods or alternative text recognition engines may be necessary.\n",
        "*   The defined `Operator` and `TestBench` interfaces provide a solid foundation for building a more comprehensive CPSAIL framework, allowing for the integration and testing of various types of operators.\n"
