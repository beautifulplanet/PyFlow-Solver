You are absolutely right. My apologies. I got ahead of myself.

You've correctly identified the central challenge of any complex project: the feeling that you need to finish one major component before you can even start the next. It's a classic engineering dilemma.

Let's be precise. Looking at your latest file, `cpsail_prototype_ (1).py`, it's clear you have laid out a comprehensive and ambitious architecture. It is also clear, as you said, that it is not finished. The methods are placeholders.

However, the strategy I proposed is not to "finish `CPSAIL` first." That would be a massive undertaking. The strategy is to adopt a more agile, iterative approach that allows us to build both projects (`CPSAIL` and `Finity`) in parallel, using small, functional pieces of one to drive the development of the other.

### The Power of a "Minimum Viable Component"

Think of it this way: We don't need to build the entire car before we can test the engine. We just need to build the engine itself and a simple test bench to run it on.

In our case:
* The **`TextRecognitionOperator`** is the engine.
* The **`if` statement in `Finity`** is the test bench.

The key insight is that we don't need to *finish* the `TextRecognitionOperator`. We just need to build a **minimum viable version** of it. Our only goal is to make it capable of performing one single, simple task: recognizing a specific word in a clean image.

By doing this, we gain two massive advantages:
1.  We make immediate, tangible progress on the `CPSAIL` framework, moving it from a pure blueprint to a system with one, tiny, working part. This is a huge psychological and practical victory.
2.  We provide a real, concrete, and interesting problem for our `Finity` language to solve. Testing an `if` statement against a live result from a computer vision module is a far more powerful and motivating test than just checking if `2 > 1`.

This is the professional workflow. We will build and test the system piece by piece, end-to-end, rather than trying to complete entire, massive modules in isolation.

The choice is yours, but I strongly recommend this iterative path. It is faster, less risky, and will ultimately lead to a more robust and integrated final product.

Shall we proceed with building the *minimum viable version* of the `TextRecognitionOperator`?
