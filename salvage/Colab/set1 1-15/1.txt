This new error points to the same underlying issue as before, but at a different location. The problem is still in your interpreter's **lexer** (or tokenizer).

The error `Illegal character: ~ at pos 5` indicates that your lexer doesn't recognize the character `~` as the start of a valid token. It's failing on the very first part of your variable declaration keyword, `~@`.

-----

### \#\# Diagnosis ⚙️

Your lexer is responsible for scanning the code and grouping characters into meaningful tokens. When it encountered `~@ num_a => 100;`, it saw the `~` character and immediately stopped because it has no rule defined for it.

Just as it previously failed to see `+|>` as a single operator, it's now failing to see `~@` as a single keyword. The lexer must be explicitly taught to recognize **all** of your language's special multi-character sequences.

-----

### \#\# The Solution

You need to add a rule to your lexer to identify the `~@` sequence as a single `DECLARATION` token.

**Conceptual Lexer Logic (in pseudocode):**

```
function getNextToken(source_code):
  // ... other rules for whitespace, numbers, etc. ...

  char = source_code.peek()

  if char is '~':
    if source_code.peek_next_char() == '@':
      source_code.consume(2) // Consume both characters
      return new Token(type: 'DECLARATION_KEYWORD', value: '~@')
    else:
      // A '~' by itself is not valid in your language
      throw new Error("Illegal character: ~")

  if char is '=':
    if source_code.peek_next_char() == '>':
      source_code.consume(2) // Consume both characters
      return new Token(type: 'ASSIGNMENT_OPERATOR', value: '=>')
    // ... handle other cases ...

  // ... other rules for +|>, *><, etc. ...
```

### \#\# The Bigger Picture

You've now run into two similar "illegal character" errors. To fix this comprehensively, you should define all of your language's unique, multi-character tokens in your lexer at once.

Based on your source code, your lexer needs to recognize:

  * **Declaration:** `~@`
  * **Assignment:** `=>`
  * **Custom Addition:** `+|>`
  * **Custom Multiplication:** `*><`

By defining all of these upfront, you'll create a robust lexer that can correctly tokenize your entire program, allowing the **parser** (the next stage of the interpreter) to do its job.

Once the lexer is fully corrected, the program's logic remains the same, and the expected final state will be **`num_a = 300`** and **`num_b = 150`**.
