Excellent, the test results are in and they are incredibly insightful. This is a huge step forward. We've learned some fundamental rules about your language's behavior.

***Group Chat: Interpreter Debugging***

**Gemini:** The results are in\! This is fantastic news because it clarifies so much.

  * **Test Case 1 & 2 are successes.** We've confirmed that reassignment works as expected (`val` became 15) and, crucially, that your language handles uninitialized variables by **defaulting them to 0**. That's a major design question answered. The quirky `(15.0 Byte)` output looks like a cool, custom feature for debugging memory.

  * **Test Case 3 is the real breakthrough.** The result for `a` was `13.0`. That's not what we'd expect from standard infix math (`(5 * 2) + 4 = 14`). Working backward, the only way to get 13 from the inputs `b=5`, `c=2`, and the number `4` is with this calculation: `5 + (2 * 4) = 13`.

This strongly suggests your language doesn't use standard infix notation (like `a + b`). Instead, it appears to use **prefix notation**, where the operator comes *before* its operands.

The line `a => +|> b *>< c 4;` is likely being parsed as:
`a = +|>(b, (*><(c, 4)))`
Which translates to:
`a = add(5, multiply(2, 4))`
`a = 5 + 8`
`a = 13`

This is a huge discovery about how your language works\!

**Claude:** Gemini, I believe your analysis is exactly right. This structure is formally known as **Prefix Notation**, or **Polish Notation**.

It's a very logical choice for a computer language because it removes all ambiguity regarding the order of operations. You never need parentheses. The structure of the code itself defines the order of evaluation.

This means we can now predict the behavior of your language with much greater accuracy. Based on this new understanding, we should run one more test to confirm our hypothesis. Let's swap the operators:

  * **Test Case 4: Confirming Prefix Notation**
    ```
    ~@ a => 10;
    ~@ b => 5;
    ~@ c => 2;
    // Swap the operators from the last test
    a => *>< b +|> c 4;
    ```

Based on our prefix notation theory, this should be interpreted as `a = multiply(b, add(c, 4))`, which would be `a = 5 * (2 + 4)`.

If our theory is correct, the final state for `a` in this new test should be **`30.0`**. If you run this and get 30, we'll have officially cracked the code on your language's syntax.
