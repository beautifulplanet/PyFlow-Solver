Of course. You've correctly diagnosed the problem: the issue isn't a single piece of code being inefficient, but the **cumulative memory usage** of running the entire development and testing process in one continuous script. A kernel restart is the result.

To prevent this, we need to shift from a monolithic script to a modular workflow. This approach will take slightly more setup time for each feature but will be far more stable and scalable, completely eliminating your RAM issues. Here is the set of directions you requested.

### \#\# Group Chat: Project Sentinel - The Modular Development Protocol

**Gemini:** You're asking for a classic time-memory tradeoff. The solution is to restructure our workflow to be memory-light, even if it means running tasks in more individual steps. The team has created a protocol that will guarantee you don't run into this issue again. Think of this as the official instruction manual for developing the Finity language from now on.

### \#\#\# The New Protocol: Develop in Isolation, Integrate with Confidence

**Athena:** The root cause of the memory issue is architectural. Your current script violates a key principle of software design: **Separation of Concerns**. You have language code, physics code, and multiple test suites all living and running in the same memory space.

Our new protocol mandates that these concerns be separated into a modular file structure. This is the blueprint for our project:

```
/project_sentinel/
|
|-- finity_core.py          # All language definitions: FinityNumber, tokenize, Parser, Interpreter
|
|-- physics_modules.py      # The EoSModule and any future physics code
|
|-- test_suites/
|   |-- test_arithmetic.py
|   |-- test_comparisons.py
|   |-- test_conditionals.py
|
|-- development_notebook.ipynb  # A temporary, disposable notebook for developing ONE new feature at a time
|
|-- master_validator.py         # A final script to run ALL tests sequentially
```

By separating the project into these files, we ensure that we only ever load the specific pieces of code we need for a given task.

**Claude:** This new architecture dictates a very specific, memory-safe workflow. Here are the step-by-step instructions for implementing a new feature, like the `if` statement, without running out of RAM.

1.  **Work in an Isolated Notebook:** Start with a fresh, clean notebook: `development_notebook.ipynb`. This is your temporary workbench. Its memory footprint is minimal.

2.  **Import the Core Language:** At the top of the notebook, import only the essential components you are modifying from your core file.

    ```python
    # In development_notebook.ipynb
    from finity_core import FinityNumber, tokenize, CorrectedParser, CorrectedInterpreter
    ```

3.  **Develop and Test the Feature:** In this notebook, write the code for the **single feature you are working on**. This means you'd add the updated `tokenize`, `CorrectedParser`, and `CorrectedInterpreter` classes *and* the `code_conditional_tests` string. Run and debug it until all tests for that one feature pass. Because only the code for this single feature is loaded, you are nowhere near the RAM limit.

4.  **Integrate Your Code:** Once the tests pass in the notebook, **copy the final, working code** into the permanent files:

      * The updated `tokenize`, `CorrectedParser`, and `CorrectedInterpreter` classes get copied into `finity_core.py`.
      * The `code_conditional_tests` and its execution logic get copied into a new file, `test_suites/test_conditionals.py`.

5.  **Clean and Reset:** You can now delete the code from your `development_notebook.ipynb` and restart its kernel. It is now clean and ready for the *next* feature. The memory is completely reclaimed.

**Janus:** My concern is ensuring that even though we develop in isolation, the entire system remains valid. A feature working alone is not enough; it must work with everything else. This is the purpose of the `master_validator.py` script.

This is **not a notebook**. It's a simple Python script you run from the command line. Its only job is to import and run every test suite from the `test_suites/` directory, one after the other. We will design it to be memory-efficient.

  * **Memory-Safe Test Execution:** We will structure each test file to have a `run_tests()` function. The master script will call one function, let it finish, and then explicitly call the garbage collector before starting the next. This ensures the memory from one test suite is released before the next one begins.

Here is what `master_validator.py` would look like:

```python
# master_validator.py
import gc
from test_suites import test_arithmetic, test_comparisons, test_conditionals

def main():
    print("--- Running Sentinel Protocol Master Validation ---")

    print("\n[Executing: Arithmetic Test Suite]")
    test_arithmetic.run_tests()
    gc.collect() # Explicitly release memory

    print("\n[Executing: Comparison Test Suite]")
    test_comparisons.run_tests()
    gc.collect() # Explicitly release memory

    print("\n[Executing: Conditional Logic Test Suite]")
    test_conditionals.run_tests()
    gc.collect() # Explicitly release memory

    print("\n--- All test suites passed successfully! ---")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

This protocol—**develop in isolated notebooks, integrate into modular files, and verify with a master script**—is the professional workflow that will prevent memory errors and allow your project to scale to any level of complexity.
