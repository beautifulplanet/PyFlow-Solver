Of course. I've conducted a full analysis of the solver code and the conversation history. The other AI's methodical approach is excellent, and its conclusion is correct: the persistent plateau in your residuals points directly to a subtle but critical bug in the boundary condition implementation.

After my own review, I've pinpointed the exact location of the error and can provide the specific fix.

The Root Cause: A Mass Conservation Conflict at the Outlet
The problem is in your calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized function. Specifically, it's this line for the outlet boundary:

u_face_e_star[:, -1] = u_star_field[:, -1] # Simple extrapolation

Hereâ€™s why this is causing the plateau:

The Pressure Condition: You've correctly set a "zero gauge pressure" outlet. In the SIMPLE algorithm, this means the pressure correction (p') at the outlet boundary is fixed at zero. The solver is not allowed to adjust the pressure there to enforce mass conservation.

The Velocity Condition: The line above calculates the outlet velocity using a simple "zero-gradient" assumption. This is just an estimate and does not guarantee that the mass flowing out of the domain exactly equals the mass flowing in.

The Conflict: During each iteration, this velocity extrapolation creates a small mass imbalance (a non-zero continuity residual) at the outlet cells. The solver's job is to create a pressure correction (p') to fix this imbalance. However, the boundary condition explicitly forbids any pressure correction at the outlet.

The solver is trapped. It sees a mass error, wants to fix it with pressure, but is not allowed to. This conflict prevents the continuity residual from ever being driven to zero, causing the exact plateau you're observing. This is a form of pressure-velocity decoupling right at the boundary.

The Solution: Enforce Global Mass Conservation
Instead of a simple local extrapolation for the outlet velocity, the correct approach is to enforce global mass conservation. This means we must adjust the outlet velocities so the total mass leaving the domain precisely matches the total mass entering.

This is a standard technique for pressure-outlet boundary conditions in incompressible solvers. The fix involves modifying the calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized function to:

Calculate the total mass flux coming in through the inlet.

Calculate the total mass flux going out based on the initial u_star_field.

Find the difference (the global mass imbalance).

Apply a correction factor to all the outlet face velocities to eliminate this imbalance.

I've created a document with the corrected version of the function that implements this global mass flow correction. This should resolve the plateauing issue and allow your benchmark test to converge to a much tighter tolerance.

I've updated the calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized function to include the global mass flow correction at the outlet. This is a targeted fix that directly addresses the inconsistency causing the convergence plateau.

By replacing your existing function with this one, the solver should now be able to properly conserve mass and drive the residuals down to your desired tolerance.

Of course. Here is the complete, corrected code for the calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized function.

This new version implements the global mass flow correction at the outlet. This change is designed to resolve the pressure-velocity decoupling issue and should allow the solver's residuals to converge properly for your benchmark case.

I've provided the complete, corrected function with the global mass flow correction integrated. This is a targeted fix that directly addresses the inconsistency that was causing the convergence plateau.

Your next step should be to replace your existing calculate_continuity_residual_actual_vectorized function with this new version and re-run the benchmark test.
