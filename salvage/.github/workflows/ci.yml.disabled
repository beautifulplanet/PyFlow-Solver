This workflow file was disabled to avoid duplicate CI definitions in the active repository root.
The canonical CI pipeline lives at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in the repository root.

If you need to resurrect any settings from this historical file, copy specific job steps manually
instead of renaming it back (which would reintroduce duplicate key diagnostics in editors).
