def test_full_solver_step_reduces_mean_free_divergence():
    """Gatekeeper (single step): mean-free divergence should not explode.

    Rationale:
      A single predictor+projection cycle can produce a *slight* uptick in the
      mean-free divergence because advection is applied before the pressure
      projection and the discretization / iterative tolerance leave small
      residual structure. Empirically a <=20% relative increase is a safe guard
      band that still flags pathological growth while avoiding flaky failures
      around a hard 10% line.

    Policy:
      - Track only the mean-free component (constant mode is Neumann invariant).
      - Allow up to +20% relative drift; anything larger suggests either the
        projection failed to converge or the predictor injected excessive
        removable divergence.
